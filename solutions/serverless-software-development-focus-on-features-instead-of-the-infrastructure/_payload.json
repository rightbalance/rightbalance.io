Your user's phone or a laptop can lose Internet connectivity at any time, run out of a battery, or even run out of memory since the capacity is limited. Client-side operating systems are very aggressive with freeing up precious resources. On Android or iOS, your app can be just killed by the operating system at any time when your app is in the background. In addition to it, your app should never crash at all costs. An app crash has a massively negative impact on your user growth and retention. While implementing your features on the client, lean on the safe side, write a lot of safeguards and null checks.
