Once the main runway was put together, each backend application was migrated over to the new runway gaining some amazing consistency for services configuration and provisioning. In addition to it, comprehensive monitoring was put in place, as well as auto-scaling elasticity, and the version control for the infrastructure templates.\n\n#### CI/CD\n\nEdmodo acceptance test suite has some great test coverage. That said, with the absence of mocking and with the growing number of edge cases to test, the suite quickly grew into 880 feature scenarios running for 1.5 hours with some mixed results. To speed up the existing acceptance tests and to make the test more robust, we introduced API level tests.\n\nWe took the existing end to end tests written in [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) and [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/), and split them into two groups of tests:\n\n1. API level tests using [Postman](http://getpostman.com/)\n2. Mocked UI tests using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)\n\nIt allows us to offload the existing Cucumber test suite and eventually migrate it towards the new stack with Postman and Cypress. In addition to it, running mocked UI tests became a lot faster. Which in turn enabled the QA team to write more precise tests covering some additional corner cases.\n\n<h3 id=\"track-analyze-reduce-aws-spent\" class=\"subheading\">Track, Analyze, and Reduce AWS Spent</h3>\n\nWe went from $650,000 a month down to $300,000 a month. How is it possible? The key is to have hard numbers that you can analyze and keep track of keeping your AWS as low as possible.\n\nFirst things first, we did a full inventory audit of the existing infrastructure including server instances, databases, buckets, etc. Next, we created a cost dashboard using [AWS QuickSight](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/). This way we can track and visualize the AWS spent.\n\nEquipped with some hard numbers, we created a battle plan to remove the unnecessary resources, downscale some overscaled resources, introduce elasticity to the picture using [Aurora Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/) and the rest of the [Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) technologies. Last but not least, we added some application-level caching reducing the load on the databases, hence lowering down database instance size.\n\n<h3 id=\"build-vs-buy\" class=\"subheading\">Build vs Buy</h3>\n\nA build vs buy decision always comes down to using your core competency as the competitive advantage. After doing an audit of the internal systems, we found out several homegrown systems that can be completely eliminated with the use of modern technologies and external services. The homegrown search was replaced by [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/). So as the homegrown CI was easily replaced with [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Doing so lowered the AWS bill, reduced the amount of maintenance overhead for the engineering team, and allowed Edmodo to use some well-known solutions in the industry.\n\n<h2 id=\"results\" class=\"heading\">Results</h2>\n\nEdmodo’s mission is impactful and inspiring. With a strong company culture, people are passionate about what they do. They work together towards a common goal: bringing accessible education to the masses. Right Balance engagement took Edmodo technology and process to the next level.\n\nModernization of the Edmodo tech stack led to a $350,000 monthly reduction in AWS bill, 30% decrease in maintenance overhead for existing systems, simple to understand architecture using the modern technologies of today. It’s easier to hire creative and forward-thinking professionals excited to work with the new technology which increases team productivity and propels innovation.","dir":"/case-studies","path":"/case-studies/better-faster-stronger-how-edmodo-leverages-best-engineering-practices-to-provide-remote-education-for-the-masses","extension":".md","slug":"better-faster-stronger-how-edmodo-leverages-best-engineering-practices-to-provide-remote-education-for-the-masses","createdAt":"2022-02-13T20:58:03.155Z","updatedAt":"2022-02-13T20:58:03.155Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1644785931024},"$loki":2},{"cta_header":"Have any questions about Data?","draft":false,"tags":["data","backend"],"related_content":[],"title":"Data is Key: How Fair Revolutionizes Car Ownership using the Highest Precision Data","short_title":"Fair - Data","header_one":"90%","header_two":"Reduction in data duplicates","header_three":null,"image_url":"https://images.rightbalance.io/uploads/fair-logo-white-3.png","toc":[{"id":"challenge","depth":2,"text":"Challenge"},{"id":"intergrity-validation","depth":3,"text":"Integrity Validation"},{"id":"data-transmission-robustness","depth":3,"text":"Data Transmission Robustness"},{"id":"lack-of-idempotency-controls","depth":3,"text":"Lack of Idempotency Controls"},{"id":"solution","depth":2,"text":"Solution"},{"id":"creating-data-validation-framework","depth":3,"text":"Creating a Data Validation Framework"},{"id":"preventing-discrepancies","depth":3,"text":"Preventing Discrepancies in the First Place"},{"id":"unit-tests-rock-solid","depth":3,"text":"Make Existing Unit Tests Rock Solid"},{"id":"execution","depth":2,"text":"Execution"},{"id":"validation-framework","depth":3,"text":"Validation Framework"},{"id":"addressing-discrepancies","depth":3,"text":"Addressing Discrepancies"},{"id":"quality-unit-tests","depth":3,"text":"Quality Unit Tests"},{"id":"results","depth":2,"text":"Results"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"className":["heading"],"id":"challenge"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Challenge"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.fair.com/","rel":["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Fair"}]},{"type":"text","value":" is one of the hottest startups in Los Angeles.

With such a fantastic mission, the company realized that the current technology doesn’t support rapid growth and scale. The current V1 system had several disadvantages:\n\n<h3 id=\"outdated-monilithic-architecture\" class=\"subheading\">Outdated Monolithic Architecture</h3>\n\nThe current solution was a monolithic system built on Laravel PHP running on a large number of legacy EC2 machines and many separate database servers. The monolithic structure wasn’t stable, it was error-prone, expensive to run, and inefficient to scale.\n\n<h3 id=\"low-visibility\" class=\"subheading\">Low Visibility Into The System</h3>\n\nDue to high data fragmentation, there was no easy way to get crucial business metrics across the company. In addition to it, a lengthy ETL process was introducing a data processing delay preventing the company from answering some crucial business questions fast.\n\n<h3 id=\"no-streamlined-process\" class=\"subheading\">No Streamlined Process</h3>\n\nSeveral major business functions required manual intervention from an engineer. This, in turn, slowed down feature development and introduced more communication overhead between some team members.\n\nThe V1 infrastructure helped the company in the early days to be agile. To take the business to the next level, a technological transformation needed to take place.\n\n<h2 id=\"solution\" class=\"heading\">Solution</h2>\n\nTo set up the business for success, Tuition.io needed a streamlined system built with the latest technology. Once the major business processes are streamlined, most of the engineering resources can be spent on developing new features delivering more value to the customers. The look and feel of the product needed to be updated to delight the customers. In addition to it, providing visibility into the system with a simple and intuitive web and native mobile interface without requiring engineering intervention is key to be able to scale.\n\n<img\n  alt=\"Bob Wall\"\n  class=\"avatar\"\n  src=\"https://images.rightbalance.io/uploads/bob.svg\"\n/>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">“In this day and age, the speed of delivery is everything. What took months to deliver now takes days and hours on the V2 system.”</p>\n<p class=\"author\">Bob Wall, VP of Engineering @ Tuition.io</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"execution\" class=\"heading\">Execution</h2>\n\nWhen it comes to moving from a fragile monolithic system to microservices with increased resiliency and scalability, there are 2 major approaches: a full rebuild or a gradual migration. Since the look and feel of the product also needed to be changed in addition to increasing the scalability of the product, it made sense to go with a full rebuild of the product. Over 12 months, The Right Balance and the Tuition.io engineering team worked together to rebuild the current system.\n\n<h3 id=\"componentized-front-end\" class=\"subheading\">Componentized Front End</h3>\n\nStarting from a stunning look and feel on the [front end](/solutions/client-side-development-enlighten-your-users-with-the-best-user-experience), most of the components were modularised allowing to reuse the existing code, decreasing the ongoing maintenance. Once the foundational components were built, it was very straightforward to achieve a consistent look of the product throughout the website as well as on the mobile app for iOS and Android. We used a [Monorepo](http://alextamoykin.com/monorepo-one-repo-to-rule-them-all) to be able to share the same components across different websites and it worked beautifully. Customer support representatives, the end-users, as well as the clients, can now see some consistent UI across the board which makes operations so much easier.\n\n<h3 id=\"serverless-microservices-on-backend\" class=\"subheading\">Serverless Microservices on the Backend</h3>\n\nOn the backend, a comprehensive data model laid out the foundation for a modular service layer and an [easy to use API](/solutions/api-development-scale-to-millions-of-users-with-a-robust-backend). Each microservice is independent and can solve its task efficiently. Microservices communicate between each other forming a strong resilient system where an outage of a single component allows the rest of the system to function as normal. Using [Serverless](/solutions/serverless-software-development-focus-on-features-instead-of-the-infrastructure) and AWS Lambda lowered the AWS bill to the minimum. It also set up the company to handle any imaginable scale.\n\n<h3 id=\"cicd\" class=\"subheading\">Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery</h3>\n\nIn addition to the development tools, a state of the art [CI/CD pipeline](/solutions/ci-cd-like-ac-dc-rock-n-roll-with-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery) was implemented allowing developers to focus on coding and utilize a continuous integration technology to run [1,342 unit tests, 320 API tests, 43 UI tests](/solutions/automated-tests-get-dividends-with-every-test-run) on every code push and to deploy multiple times a day on demand.\n\n<h3 id=\"data-migration\" class=\"subheading\">Data Migration</h3>\n\nOnce the new system was built, the migration tools were implemented to migrate the existing clients from V1 into V2 system seamlessly maintaining the data integrity. Once the data was transformed from the old format into the new format and loaded automatically, the users were able to log in seamlessly, enjoying the whole new look of the site as well as the new exciting features.\n\n<h3 id=\"mobile\" class=\"subheading\">Mobile</h3>\n\nSince the web apps were written in Vue.js, using NativeScript for mobile apps was a natural choice. Using the same programming language and technologies everyone on the team is already familiar with, the new apps delivered some great experience for the users. iOS and Android users were able to log in to their accounts and manage their student loans from the convenience of their mobile phones. Important to note that both native apps (iOS and Android) were produced from a single codebase which reduces the maintenance overhead.\n\n<h2 id=\"results\" class=\"heading\">Results</h2>\n\nToday, Tuition.io runs on the new system constantly onboarding new clients, servicing millions of dollars of student loan debt each month. The system is built with the latest technologies including AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Vue.js, Node.js with Typescript, and NativeScript for mobile apps. The company was also able to cut their AWS AWS bill by 74% using Serverless technology. With Serverless, Tuition.io only pays for resources used as opposed to paying for idling servers in the past. Company engineers enjoy working in a modern technology stack producing some high-quality code every day. In addition, the product has a great smooth user experience with high visibility into the data. Employees have a clear picture of their student debt situation. Employers understand how their employees are doing in terms of their financial wellness. Tuition.io operational staff can solve customer support issues as well as onboard new clients effectively without requiring some manual intervention from engineering. Data Analysts have a clear view of the business allowing the stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.\n","dir":"/case-studies","path":"/case-studies/from-monolith-to-serverless-microservices-how-tuition-io-disrupts-one-trillion-dollar-student-debt-industry-with-new-technology","extension":".md","slug":"from-monolith-to-serverless-microservices-how-tuition-io-disrupts-one-trillion-dollar-student-debt-industry-with-new-technology","createdAt":"2022-02-13T20:58:03.159Z","updatedAt":"2022-02-13T20:58:03.159Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1644785931060},"$loki":4},{"cta_header":"Have any questions about Desktop Apps?","tags":["desktop","electron","vue.js","serverless","jamstack"],"related_content":[],"title":"From Nothing to 100+ Countries Worldwide with Commandeer: Cloud Software Solution for Developers","short_title":"Commandeer - Desktop App","header_one":"100+ Countries","header_two":"Use Commandeer desktop app","header_three":null,"image_url":"https://images.rightbalance.io/uploads/commandeer-logo-white2.png","toc":[{"id":"challenge","depth":2,"text":"Challenge"},{"id":"solution","depth":2,"text":"Solution"},{"id":"desktop-app","depth":3,"text":"Desktop app"},{"id":"website","depth":3,"text":"Website"},{"id":"static-content-cms","depth":3,"text":"CMS for Static Content"},{"id":"execution","depth":2,"text":"Execution"},{"id":"cross-platform-desktop-solution","depth":3,"text":"Cross-Platform Desktop Solution with Electron.js"},{"id":"modular-web-components-with-vuejs","depth":3,"text":"Modular and Robust web components with Vue.js & Typescript"},{"id":"serverlss-aws-lambda-and-appsync","depth":3,"text":"Cost-Efficient API with Serverless, AWS Lambda, and AppSync"},{"id":"payments-with-stripe","depth":3,"text":"Payments with Stripe"},{"id":"documentation-website-with-vuepress-and-forestry","depth":3,"text":"Documentation site in VuePress with Forestry CMS"},{"id":"landing-pages-with-nuxt","depth":3,"text":"Landing pages with Nuxt.js"},{"id":"jamstack-all-the-way","depth":3,"text":"JAMStack All The Way"},{"id":"results","depth":2,"text":"Results"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"className":["heading"],"id":"challenge"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Challenge"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In today’s world, most of the software is developed in the cloud.

In this article, we share how a new architectural design helped us drive sustainable growth for the company as well as solve one of our customers’ top pain points.\n\n## Architectural Design\n\nThe new architectural design we built involves SQS queues and AWS lambda functions. We decided to use this design because of several factors:\n\n1. **Resiliency.** Each event has business value, so we wanted to ensure that no events are dropped under heavy traffic. Placing events on a durable SQS queue as they occur allows us to retain them as well as retry delivering them in case of a processing failure.\n2. **Elasticity.** One of the main advantages of serverless technology is the ability to use resources on demand. AWS lambdas are only billed at the times when they are invoked.\n3. **Flexibility.** Managing events in a queue and lambdas allows us to swap out each component easily, which opens up more possibilities for future use cases.\n\n## Case Study 1: Sending post-install data\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n  <img alt=\"Tala mobile app\" src=\"https://images.rightbalance.io/uploads/device-home-screen.png\" />\n</div>\n\nLike many businesses, Tala’s marketing team uses digital advertising channels to introduce our product to new audiences.

This architecture is much more resilient and accurate than the team’s previous client-side event tracking solution.\n\nTala’s engineering team designed, built, and tested the new framework over several sprints. Our marketing team then ran a scaled Facebook campaign and realized a significantly higher return on ad spend when optimizing for post-install events compared to install events, in addition to maintaining 100% uptime and data accuracy.\n\n## Case Study 2: Preventing fraud\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n  <img alt=\"Device issue screen\" src=\"https://images.rightbalance.io/uploads/device-issue.png\" />\n</div>\n\nIn emerging markets such as Kenya, the second-hand phone market is massive.

Because Tala uses device data (with user permission) to underwrite personal loans, the following is a common scenario:\n\n* Person A installs app on phone and signs up for Tala\n* Person A sells phone to Person B\n* Person B cannot sign up for Tala on phone\n\nTala’s legacy device management rules, used to prevent fraud, were blocking tens of thousands of new users per month from signing up and were one of the largest drivers of customer support tickets globally.

In this role, the engineer makes technological and architectural\ncontributions across the entire company and improves engineering performance as a result of that.\n\n<a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134032802/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0134032802&linkCode=as2&tag=howtoprogramb-20&linkId=993a83c211014757e438477ed1087438\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=0134032802&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=howtoprogramb-20\" ></a><img src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=howtoprogramb-20&l=am2&o=1&a=0134032802\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />\n\nIt's important to note that a Principal Software Engineer also has to have some managerial skills since the impact\nof this person's work spans across the entire organization. There are numerous books on the subject.\nour favorite is [The Art of Scalability](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134032802/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=howtoprogramb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0134032802&linkId=46a5776c76ddec05de77943cb1798fba).\nIt starts by describing different functions of the technical organization, how they are all connected together,\nand how it connects with technology. It's interesting to note that even though the technology aspect is quite hard\nto implement, it's connecting technology with business functions of the organization is what gives the best results.\n\nNo matter which way you go, as long as you grow within the company, you'll have more impact, bring more value,\nand you'll get paid more. At the end of the days, it's just a personal preference. If you like coding and you're not\na big fan of people management, you can safely stick to the technical track. If you're passionate about hiring,\nmentoring, and people management then talk to your manager about getting on the management track when the right time comes.\n\n## Finishing thoughts\nWe spend so much of our life working on products. You want to make sure you’re happy at your workplace.\nTalk to your manager about your long-term career goals and plans. Everybody wins when you grow. Work hard, have fun\nand the right things will happen.\n\nOriginally posted on [alextamoykin.com](https://alextamoykin.com/do-you-have-to-become-a-manager-to-advance-as-a-software-engineer)\n","dir":"/learn","path":"/learn/do-you-have-to-become-a-manager-to-advance-as-a-software-engineer","extension":".md","slug":"do-you-have-to-become-a-manager-to-advance-as-a-software-engineer","createdAt":"2022-02-13T20:58:03.159Z","updatedAt":"2022-02-13T20:58:03.159Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1644785931100},"$loki":7},{"tags":["hiring","management"],"related_content":[],"title":"How to Hire Best People","short_title":"Hire Best People","header_one":"Hire Best People","icon":"trophy","cta_header":"Need help hiring software engineers?","toc":[{"id":"where-to-find-the-best-people","depth":2,"text":"Where to find the best people"},{"id":"referrals","depth":3,"text":"Referrals"},{"id":"recruiters","depth":3,"text":"Recruiters"},{"id":"diy-search","depth":3,"text":"DIY Search"},{"id":"contractors","depth":3,"text":"Contractors"},{"id":"interview","depth":2,"text":"Interview"},{"id":"hire","depth":2,"text":"Hire"},{"id":"final-thoughts","depth":2,"text":"Final Thoughts"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"blockquote","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and then tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Steve Jobs"}]}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Hiring the best people is at the core of every successful organization.

They get invited to all your ceremonies and existing meetings\nlike standups, sprint plannings, retrospectives, etc. It allows you to continue taking advantage of the processes you\nalready have by rinse repeating what works for your team.\n\n### Flexibility\nAdditional resources can be added as you need it. The goal of staff augmentation is to provide extra resources quickly\ninstead of having positions open for a while. Staff augmentation arrangements usually come in the form of a contract as\nopposed to an employment relationship that has multiple advantages. In case if the candidate doesn't work out, granted\nthe candidate was hired using a solid contracting firm, the firm can arrange a replacement. Worth noting that doing so\nwith full time employees is more complicated because of the local employment laws.\n\n### Hit the ground running\nSoftware developers who work in staff augmentation are usually very skilled. They are professionally trained to be\nproductive and make an impact from day one. They've been on multiple projects and they can bring their expertise to\nyour project. Needless to say, to be successful at staff augmentation you need to be a top-level player.\nIt takes some skills to be productive in any environment quickly.\n\n### Additional Skills\nAdding new team members on the team can bring some additional skills that you may not yet have.\nFor instance, if you add someone skilled at Front End development when your internal expertise is on the Back End\nallows you to establish some best practices with the new technology in house. It's also a great opportunity to have\nyour existing team learn from the experience of some new team members who delivered several production grade projects\nwith new technology.\n\n## Disadvantages of Staff Augmentation and How To Address Them\nNothing is perfect, staff augmentation also has some disadvantages. That said, most of the disadvantages can be\naddressed by following some engineering best practices.\n\n### Retaining The Knowledge\nMaking sure that your institutional knowledge stays withing the core in-house team is key.\nThe work performed by contractors needs to follow the regular process. Several industry-proven strategies help to\nretain your knowledge:\n\n#### Code Reviews\nMaking sure that your team members review each other's code has several advantages. It increases the collaboration\nbetween the team members and sparks conversations about some new ideas. Best of all, it helps the team to maintain\nand improve the code quality.\n\n#### Automated Tests\nIn addition to being able to run your [automated tests](/solutions/automated-tests-get-dividends-with-every-test-run)\nto make sure the system works, tests are also your documentation. When written properly,\nit can tell you exactly how your system works. And better yet, green tests are the proof of it working as expected.\n\n#### Documentation\nLast but not least, it's the documentation itself. Each modification to the existing architecture needs to be\ndocumented in the form of design documents and architectural diagrams.\n\n### Alignment in Core Values\nWhen choosing your software development partner, it's important to make sure that your core values align with the\npartner's core values. If there is a misalignment, it can create some extra tension on the team.\nAnd when the values are aligned, it amplifies the advantages of both sides.\n\n### Something New\nIf you haven't hired any contractors in the past, it can be something new for you. Bringing new people on the project\ncan seem like a challenging task at first. In practice, it's usually very straightforward. Firms specializing in staff\naugmentation have the process streamlined with an easy-to-understand contract and some highly skilled staff ready to\nmake progress right away. At the end of the day, working together is a win-win situation for both parties.\nA great company will help you get through the process each step of the way.\n\n## Conclusion\nStaff augmentation is a great way to add some extra horsepower to your team. New team members are professionally\ntrained to hit the ground running quickly by working on your terms and following the existing processes. By following\nthe best industry practices like automated testing, code reviews, and comprehensive documentation you're able to retain\nthe knowledge within your in-house team. The arrangement is flexible where you can add people quickly and replace\nthem in case someone doesn't work out.\n","dir":"/learn","path":"/learn/staff-augmentation-how-to-get-some-extra-help-when-you-need-it","extension":".md","slug":"staff-augmentation-how-to-get-some-extra-help-when-you-need-it","createdAt":"2022-02-13T20:58:03.159Z","updatedAt":"2022-02-13T20:58:03.159Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1644785931126},"$loki":9},{"tags":["hiring","management"],"related_content":[],"title":"Why Hiring Senior Engineers is Hard And How to Solve It","short_title":"Why hiring engineers is hard","header_two":"Why Hiring Senior Engineers","header_three":"is Hard","icon":"star","cta_header":"Need help hiring senior engineers?","toc":[{"id":"overview","depth":2,"text":"Overview"},{"id":"why-hiring-is-hard","depth":2,"text":"Why Hiring Is Hard"},{"id":"how-to-solve-engineering-deficit","depth":2,"text":"How To Solve Engineering Deficit"},{"id":"growing-existing-talent","depth":3,"text":"Growing Existing Talent"},{"id":"hiring-junior-engineers-or-interns","depth":3,"text":"Hiring Junior Engineers or Interns"},{"id":"contractors","depth":3,"text":"Contractors"},{"id":"contract-to-hire","depth":3,"text":"Contract to hire"},{"id":"final-thoughts","depth":2,"text":"Final Thoughts"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"overview"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#overview","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Overview"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"If you're in an engineering leadership position like Engineering Manager, Director, VP, CTO, one of your main responsibilities is to grow your engineering team.

A properly implemented backend API allows you to drink your IPA while your entire system works for you.\n\n## API Anatomy\n\nHere is what a typical API looks like:\n\n### API Gateway\n\nWhen a client request comes from a web browser, mobile app, or a third party, the first place it goes to is an API Gateway. The goal of API Gateway is to route the request to a specific destination, which is a microservice most of the time. Depending on the API Gateway implementation, it can also handle user authentication and some request transformation before handing it off to the microservice. Last but not least, API Gateway handles the first level of security by routing a request coming from the public Internet to a private resource. Important to note that all resources behind the API Gateway like your microservices and database should remain private and not being exposed to the Internet. Only API Gateway should have the ability to route the right request from the public to the private territory.\n\n### Service Layer\n\nThat’s where the magic happens. Most of your business logic is contained at this level. If you have microservices architecture, different requests will go to different microservices. Depending on your use-case, your service can do any number of things like making a database query, calling another microservice or a 3rd party API, caching some data for future use, writing into a queue, or performing some computation.\n\n## How to Build APIs Right\n\n### Architecture\n\nA properly architected system is at the core of a robust and scalable API. If your API is architected well, everything else comes together naturally. Your product will be able to support your level of traffic and you’ll have a lot of happy customers.\n\nWhen designing your API, you’ll need to minimize the following:\n\n1. A number of single points of failure (which is a database in most cases).\n2. A number of internal calls between services.\n3. Timing of each individual call.\n\nThe main thing to realize is that each call results in a chain of events. While the work is happening the user is waiting for a response. Time and time again we’ve seen a seemingly quick API call taking a long time or sometimes taking the system down. Everyone on the team needs to have a clear idea of which calls are made for each operation and which resources are used during each call. There are a lot of tools out there like [NewRelic](https://newrelic.com/ \"NewRelic website\") or [DataDog](https://www.datadoghq.com/ \"DataDog page\") that help you measure the timing of each individual call between services. You’ll be able to fix the issues before the software gets pushed to prod by instrumenting your app and running some [load tests](/solutions/automated-tests-get-dividends-with-every-test-run#load-tests) against it in your testing environment.\n\n### Scalability\n\nOnce the system is architected for scale, supporting more traffic or less traffic should be as simple as a configuration change. Here are the main things to consider:\n\n#### Scaling Automatically\n\nMost of the cloud providers have auto-scaling capabilities based on certain rules you can specify. In addition to it, we recommend looking into [Serverless tech](/solutions/serverless-software-development-focus-on-features-instead-of-the-infrastructure) allowing for scaling automatically with the increase or decrease in traffic. If your server provisioning is manual at the moment, it’s worth thinking about automating it. This way you can spend your engineering resources on developing new features or improving the strength of the overall system instead of manually provisioning servers.\n\n#### Minimize Service Chaining\n\nEspecially with microservices, it’s easy to fall into a trap of ‘nano services’. Making your services too granular can lead to an increase in the number of inner service calls. It’s a good idea to avoid making one service call another service and so on and so forth. The longer the call chain, the greater the possibility of a failure at each step, and the overall call length increases too. In addition to it, debugging a call spanning across multiple services is much harder than debugging a single call to a single service.\n\n#### Alerting and Monitoring\n\nAlerting and monitoring is your best friend. It should be a part of the requirement for every feature. When your alerting and monitoring are properly set up you sleep better at night. It allows you to be more proactive about fixing the issues before they become problems. If something goes wrong, you’ll get notified and you’ll stay ahead of the game. This also increases the accountability of your team. The systems need to be developed so they always work without human intervention.\n\nA great book on a subject is [Art of Scalability](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134032802/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=howtoprogramb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0134032802&linkId=55bea73bd8158a7441b84e4d4921bbb3 \"The art of scalability book\").\n\n### Cost Efficiency\n\nYour backend API is what makes your system scale to support a large number of users. With the increase in traffic comes the increase in cost. Therefore, when building your backend, you should be aware of the cost implications of your implementation decisions. We recommend focusing on the following areas:\n\n#### Keeping your operational database slim\n\nThe main purpose of your operational database is to serve the immediate API requests. Anything else adds to the database size, decreases the database availability, and makes scaling the database harder, especially for SQL databases.\n\n#### Keeping your non-production environments small\n\nDepending on your use-case, you’ll need a number of different environments. For a simple scenario having just 3 environments works just fine (development, staging, and production). As your organization grows, you’ll have more use cases you need to support and the number of environments will grow too. The key here is to have all production and pre-production environments with the same configuration. And all the rest of the systems with a scaled-down version of your resources to keep the cost down. In addition to it, using Serverless or Containers helps to minimize idle server time.\n\n#### Using the right tool for the job\n\nWe’ve seen many cases where a SQL database stores all application logs, acts as a search index for different kinds of queries, and even acts as a data warehouse while providing data for the API requests. There are solutions made specifically for each type of problem to solve. Logs can be archived into some flat files and processed offline. There are plenty of search solutions like [Elastic Search](https://www.elastic.co/ \"Elastic Search page\") or [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/ \"Algolia Website\"). A data warehouse needs to be separate from your runtime operational database so your data analyst doesn’t bring your runtime system down. Plus data warehouse users need the data in a different format. When using the right solution for each type of problem, you’ll be able to provide a better experience for the users. You’ll also have better control over your system cost.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYour backend infrastructure is the heart of your system. It supports your client applications at scale. Architecting your backend system right makes everything else easier. Using the right tool for the job is key. There are specialized solutions for each type of problem. The goal is to build it so it always works with some comprehensive alerting and monitoring in place notifying you about the issues in advance.

What makes testing easier is structuring your code in a modular way. Modularizing your architecture allows you to swap out or refactor each module in isolation without affecting the rest of the system.\n\nIn addition to your code being modular, your code will also be more robust.

Automated tests help exercise all code paths involved so you can focus on the task at hand as opposed to constantly retesting the entire system and hypothesizing where it can break.\n\n### Tests are Your Documentation\n\nTests document the existing behavior of your system. When structured correctly, and especially with the use of [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development#:\\~:text=In%20software%20engineering%2C%20behavior%2Ddriven,participants%20in%20a%20software%20project. \"Behavior Driven Development\") syntax, your tests are your system documentation. You can use it to ramp up new engineers as well as a reference for how your system works in practice.\n\n### Tests Prove That Your System Works\n\nThe code you write may be the greatest code ever and you may think it works. That being said, you never know if it actually works until it’s in production serving real customers. A green test suite is proof of your code working as expected as opposed to a guess or a good feeling that your system will work.\n\n### Get Dividends With Each Test Run\n\nWriting automated tests is an investment that pays dividends with every test run. Once the test is written, there is no need to execute it again manually. You can run an automated test at any time on-demand, or have it running automatically on every new code change. Every time you run it, it makes sure your system behaves the way it should.\n\n## Disadvantages of Automated Testing\n\nThe main disadvantage of automated testing is that it makes a large sweeping change harder. If you’re writing a prototype, or your product didn’t achieve the product-market fit, then automated tests will get in the way of pivoting or making a full restructure change. Ironically, this is one of the most common reasons for not adopting automated testing. The teams we’ve seen tried to do it too early. After having some bad experience with it, they stopped testing altogether and never came back to it. Only discovering later that they wrote a lot of tightly coupled code that is hard to test.\n\n## Efficient Testing Strategy\n\nOur recommendation is to double down on unit tests, write fewer integration tests, and fewer UI/API tests. Why? Because unit tests are the easiest to write, fastest to run, easiest to parallelize, and it forces you to produce a robust baseline for your modular architecture. Integration and unit tests have some great coverage. On another hand it’s hard to write integration tests, they are slower and more brittle. Let’s go over each kind of test in detail.\n\n## Anatomy of Automated Testing\n\n### Unit Tests\n\nUnit tests test a specific unit of code. They’re usually isolated testing a specific class, a specific function, or a small group of classes and functions. Unit Tests are usually written by the engineers while the functionality is implemented. Most of the business logic is covered by unit tests. Since the unit of code under each test is relatively small, you can set up different conditions for each test. It works especially well when setting up each test with some randomized data. Unit tests are quickest to run, they are the easiest to parallelize and optimize. We recommend writing most of your test cases at the unit test level.\n\n### Integration Tests\n\nWhile unit tests test each unit of code in isolation, an integration test tests how multiple units work together. Due to a higher level of complexity, these tests are usually slower to run, harder to set up, and harder to parallelize. It’s also harder to test boundary conditions because the test set up is more complicated. That’s why we recommend writing fewer cases and structuring your integration tests to cover a larger number of integration points in each test.\n\n### UI / API Tests\n\nUI Tests drive your GUI (i.e. click or tap actual buttons on the screen, etc) and API tests drive your API (i.e. sending real HTTP or GraphQL requests to your endpoints, etc). As you probably guessed UI or API tests are one of the slowest to run and the most complicated to set up. The reason is that they operate at the UI or API level which is usually just the tip of the iceberg. That being said, UI or API tests give you the most coverage for the number of tests. Here, we recommend going with a few happy paths to make sure everything behaves as needed, all screens render properly and all requests come back as normal.\n\n### Test Suite\n\nSince you get the main benefit of automated tests when you execute it, your test suite is your best friend. The test suite runs all necessary tests in sequence parallelizing tests where it’s possible. Depending on your situation you may have several test suites running at different stages of the process. We recommend creating a robust [CI/CD pipeline](/solutions/ci-cd-like-ac-dc-rock-n-roll-with-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery) which runs before merging your feature branches and when you deploy your code.\n\n### Load Tests\n\nAs the name suggests, load tests test your system under load. There are numerous tools available starting from a simple CLI tool like [Apache Benchmark](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html \"Apache Benchmark Overview\") to more sophisticated solutions with a GUI like [jMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/ \"jMeter\") or [Locust](https://locust.io/ \"Locust\"). We recommend performing load testing in a separate environment similar in capacity to a production environment. This way we compare apples to apples. Before running the tests, make sure your monitoring is set up so you can see the metrics before, during, and after the test. Depending on your system, you might want to monitor your database throughput, CPU / Memory / Hard Disk usage of your application servers, etc.\n\n## How To Start With Automated Testing\n\nAll it takes is just starting to do it. If you don’t have a test suite running, getting it to run and putting it on CI is the first step. There are several ways to give the team visibility into the health of your automated tests. You can enable CI notifications about the failed builds to go to Slack. Another helpful technique is exposing the CI status as a dashboard on a TV in the office. Once you have your tests running seeing your test data will become eye-opening. Even if your test suite has just a few tests.\n\nIf you’re dealing with a monolithic tightly coupled system, the main thing is to start carving out some pieces of the monolith into smaller chunks which are easier to test in isolation. Step by step you’ll be able to take your system under control.\n\n## Advanced Topics\n\n* [Dependency Injection and Mocking](https://www.objc.io/issues/15-testing/dependency-injection/ \"Objc.io issue on dependency injection and mocking\")\n* [Data Randomization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_testing \"Data randomization in testing\")\n* [Mutation Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing \"Mutation testing\")\n\n## Book References\n\n* [Working With Legacy Code](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131177052/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=howtoprogramb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0131177052&linkId=987b7883189add3eef3cd3b2c3f31b1d \"Working with legacy code book\")\n* [Refactoring](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134757599/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=howtoprogramb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0134757599&linkId=5afcd14ce8949fc392799e8d92ca6535 \"Refactoring book\")\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAutomated testing is a great way to make sure you write modular and robust code that always works. You get the proof that your system works as expected with every run. Adding more test cases to your system has a cumulative effect since you get the dividends with every run of your test suite.

We’ve several different branching strategies like [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ \"Git flow branching strategy\"). All of the strategies have one thing in common. There is a single mainline development branch. Each developer creates his/her own branch of the mainline and works independently on a feature.

Consistency makes your compliance process easier to maintain. And while the CI server is running your pipeline, you have your developers writing some new features.

Important to note that if failures happen along the way, the pipeline notifies the developer of the failed step so the action can be taken promptly.\n\n## How You Can Implement CI/CD\n\n### Lock in Your Branching Strategy\n\nWe recommend following [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ \"Git Flow Overview\") or some variation of it. Making sure everyone follows the same process for branching makes everything easier. If you have multiple environments (like development, staging, and production) you may want to name your branches the same way so it’s easy to map the branches to the environments the code should be deployed to.\n\n### Build, Test, Deploy\n\nChances are, you either already have a way to build, test, and deploy your code. The goal here is to distill it down to a single command you can run from your terminal. If your build process involves running multiple commands, no problem, we’ll just write a build script running each step. If you don’t have automated tests, the best first step is to set up a testing framework and add it to the CI pipeline. Once tests run automatically, it’s easy to add them one by one gradually. Last but not least, your deployment has to happen using a single command. What we’ve seen in the past is that a lot of software teams end up with a large spreadsheet of steps to run for each release. Worry not, each of those massive spreadsheets can be distilled down to a single command step by step.\n\n### Pipeline it\n\nNow you have all your steps in order, it’s easy to put it together into a pipeline. There are numerous technology choices starting from self-hosted options like [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/ \"Jenkins Website\") all the way to some hosted solutions like [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/ \"CircleCI website\") and [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/ \"Azure Pipelines - CI/CD from Azure\"). It all depends on your system and your current technology stack. At this point, it comes down to either creating an account for a hosted CI provider or standing up Jenkins inside your infrastructure and wiring the steps together with some configuration files using YAML or similar configuration language. Yes, we want our infrastructure to [run as code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code \"IAC overview\") so we can stand it up at any time.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCI/CD is key to increasing velocity, developer productivity, and it’s just more fun to focus on features. Which in turn drives the business forward. If you’re in a manual world without the pipeline or perhaps even without the automated tests in place, starting on CI/CD route might seem like an overwhelming task. Worry not, with the right processes in place and some persistence, you’ll get to a place where all you do is push some new code and let the pipeline do the rest of the magic.\n\nIf you would like to get some help with implementing CI/CD into your organization, don’t hesitate to reach out.

Client-side development is centered around developing client-side applications. Mobile applications, websites, desktop apps are all examples of a client-side application. When your users interact with your product, the only thing they see is your client-side user interface. That’s why building your client-side applications right is crucial to deliver an enlightening user experience.\n\n## Client-Side Application Architecture\n\nA typical client-side application consists of the following main components:\n\n### User Interface\n\nAll visual elements like buttons, different color backgrounds, images, etc, and most of the interactions between them are your user interface. At this level, you’ll work primarily with the layout frameworks like [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit) / [Swift UI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/ \"Swift UI framework from Apple\") for iOS, your favorite Javascript and CSS framework for your web application like [React](https://reactjs.org/ \"React JS Framework\"), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/ \"Vue JS Framework\"), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/ \"Svelte\"), etc.\n\nAll code powering your UI runs in the main thread of the application.

This layer performs the actual network requests, parses the data coming from the API.

You deploy your code and your cloud provider manages the servers for you under the hood. It allows you to focus on your code minimizing the amount of effort spent on the infrastructure.\n\n## Why Serverless Matters\n\n### Pay per use\n\nNo need to pay for idle servers. With Serverless, you only pay for the time it takes to run your application. If you aren’t using your system, you don’t incur any runtime costs. It’s ideal for your development, staging, and QA environments which aren’t used 24/7.\n\n### All major cloud providers support Serverless\n\n[Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/), [Google GCP](https://cloud.google.com/serverless), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/serverless/), and many more providers support Serverless technology. Most of them continue to integrate Serverless further into more of their products. We’re already seeing [Amazon Aurora Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/) database and [Fargate Container](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) engine following the same Serverless principles of paying for only when the resources are used. Serverless is entering the mainstream phase now. There are plenty of resources and libraries online to help you.\n\n<img\nalt=\"Cloud Providers\"\nclass=\"left\"\nsrc=\"https://images.rightbalance.io/uploads/cloud-providers.svg\"\n/>\n\n### Infinitely Scalable\n\nServerless resources grow and shrink automatically with your demand. More Serverless resources are spawned up when more requests are coming. If there are no requests at all, no resources are running.\n\n### Be At the Forefront of Technology\n\nRunning on your own hardware is complicated and unnecessary (unless you’re at a scale of Google or Amazon), so as running on dedicated virtualized servers (like [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)). Over the next 5 years, Serverless will become the norm and a default choice for new development. Working with new technology is exciting for you and your team! Don’t miss the opportunity to be ahead of the game instead of playing catch up.\n\n## Business Problems Serverless Solves\n\n### Power your Websites, Mobile Apps, and IoT Devices\n\nServerless functions plugs in directly into your API Gateway or GraphQL endpoints. This means they can power your client applications like mobile apps, websites, IoT devices, and the rest of the backend microservices.\n\n### Deliver relevant data to stakeholders\n\nIn our day and age, having access to the relevant data is everything. It’s very straightforward to connect your serverless function to a queue, a pub-sub system, a database or even your file storage bucket. In the case of AWS, all of the major data services like [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/), [SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) all support the ability to trigger a serverless function to take the data that just arrived, transform it and deliver it to some relevant parties. No need to build some brutal long-running ETL jobs introducing some update delays. Process the data as it comes in, and deliver it to your data warehouse close to real-time.\n\n### Reduce Infrastructure Cost\n\nNo need to pay for your servers sitting around doing no work, right? Same for your database, if it’s not being used in your QA environment overnight, why pay for it? By moving more and more resources to Serverless, you reduce your costs and make your CFO happy 💸\n\n### Increase Development Velocity\n\nBusiness opportunities come and go quickly. Being able to develop your software fast, deploy it, and have it run automatically is key for growing your business. Serverless technology allows you to do exactly that. Just focus on your features and let your cloud provider take care of the infrastructure for you.\n\n### Handle Traffic Spikes Seamlessly\n\nEver got a notification about your servers going down because of a marketing campaign bringing more traffic? With a well-architected Serverless system, with all bottlenecks removed (or moved to Serverless) you’ll be able to support any unexpected spike in traffic. With more traffic coming to the system, more serverless functions are spawned up to support the increasing demand.
