In this article, we share how a new architectural design helped us drive sustainable growth for the company as well as solve one of our customers’ top pain points.\n\n## Architectural Design\n\nThe new architectural design we built involves SQS queues and AWS lambda functions. We decided to use this design because of several factors:\n\n1. **Resiliency.** Each event has business value, so we wanted to ensure that no events are dropped under heavy traffic. Placing events on a durable SQS queue as they occur allows us to retain them as well as retry delivering them in case of a processing failure.\n2. **Elasticity.** One of the main advantages of serverless technology is the ability to use resources on demand. AWS lambdas are only billed at the times when they are invoked.\n3. **Flexibility.** Managing events in a queue and lambdas allows us to swap out each component easily, which opens up more possibilities for future use cases.\n\n## Case Study 1: Sending post-install data\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n  <img alt=\"Tala mobile app\" src=\"https://images.rightbalance.io/uploads/device-home-screen.png\" />\n</div>\n\nLike many businesses, Tala’s marketing team uses digital advertising channels to introduce our product to new audiences. Early last year, the effectiveness of Tala’s Facebook and Google ads were being primarily measured by install events (i.e., users who download the app). We quickly identified an opportunity to improve the effectiveness of campaigns by optimizing ads for  post-install events rather than downloads.\n\n![Alex and Rachel at Tala’s HQ in Santa Monica, CA.](https://images.rightbalance.io/uploads/ideation.png)\n> Alex and Rachel at Tala’s HQ in Santa Monica, CA.\n\nThe marketing team identified several high-priority post-install events, which we set up triggers for on backend services. When an event is triggered, a file is sent to an SQS queue. The lambda function then retrieves this information from the queue and passes it to our marketing platform API. This architecture is much more resilient and accurate than the team’s previous client-side event tracking solution.\n\nTala’s engineering team designed, built, and tested the new framework over several sprints. Our marketing team then ran a scaled Facebook campaign and realized a significantly higher return on ad spend when optimizing for post-install events compared to install events, in addition to maintaining 100% uptime and data accuracy.\n\n## Case Study 2: Preventing fraud\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n  <img alt=\"Device issue screen\" src=\"https://images.rightbalance.io/uploads/device-issue.png\" />\n</div>\n\nIn emerging markets such as Kenya, the second-hand phone market is massive. Consumers are also sensitive to download and storage size due to device and data constraints. Because Tala uses device data (with user permission) to underwrite personal loans, the following is a common scenario:\n\n* Person A installs app on phone and signs up for Tala\n* Person A sells phone to Person B\n* Person B cannot sign up for Tala on phone\n\nTala’s legacy device management rules, used to prevent fraud, were blocking tens of thousands of new users per month from signing up and were one of the largest drivers of customer support tickets globally. In addition, this problem had grown 3x in volume over the past 2 years and was expected to continue increasing exponentially the longer the company operated in a given market.\n\nIn this situation, we launched a set of new device management rules and a lambda function.

You’re excited to launch it. There is a lot of interesting product ideas that you incorporated into it. You keep thinking: “Just one last feature and it will be perfect!”. Finally, you push the button, the product is live but it doesn’t perform the way you expected. Sounds familiar? After reading this post, you’ll learn a better way to deliver a _better product faster_.\n\n## Why adding a lot of features slows you down\n\nIf your awesome product has all features in the world, it’s exactly where the problem is. More features come at the cost of the following things:\n\n1. Feedback loop increase. It takes longer to build more functionality into the product. It delays time to market and it delays getting valuable customer feedback.\n2. You don’t know what works until you test it. You’re not your target audience. What works for you will not necessarily work for your customer.\n3. Building a product gets harder the more features you add to it. User experience gets confusing.\n\n## Agile methodology to the rescue\n\nThe process of planning ahead for a complete product is called [Waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model). There is nothing bad about the waterfall process. It works, people build things like spaceships and aircrafts with it successfully. However, the waterfall methodology has one important drawback: you might spend a lot of time implementing a fully-featured solution that doesn't work well for the customer. It's best illustrated in a classic comic from [project cartoon](http://projectcartoon.com/) (also mentioned as [Tree Swing Picture](https://archive.is/FgxPK \"Tree Swing Picture archived\") in an archived source):\n\n![](https://images.rightbalance.io/uploads/waterfall_comic.jpeg)\n\nAs you may see from the picture above, there is a fundamental disconnect between how the person implementing it or even a customer sees the product and what the customer actually needs. After numerous companies fell into this trap, a group of smart individuals invented the methodology called Agile which solves this problem. You can find the agile definition in [The Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/ \"Agile Manifesto\"). The main idea is to short-circuit a long iteration cycle by building the product in small increments, testing it with a real customer, and pivoting. In other words, instead of planning for a rich feature set in advance, you plan for a _minimum_ feature set needed, ship it, and learn from it. _Then and only then_ you decide what to build next. Here are the main advantages of agile project management:\n\n1. It shortens the feedback loop so you can iterate faster.\n2. You build a better product based on the customer input.\n3. The team feels a greater sense of ownership since it’s more involved working with the customer.\n\n## How you can implement the Agile methodology for your team\n\n<a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356581/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1934356581&linkCode=as2&tag=howtoprogramb-20&linkId=4ec447bfbee241d0cf58ac54d9b36686\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=1934356581&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=howtoprogramb-20\" ></a><img src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=howtoprogramb-20&l=am2&o=1&a=1934356581\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />\n\nIf you would like to know more about Agile, I encourage you to read [The Agile Samurai](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356581/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=howtoprogramb-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1934356581&linkId=be6e2304236fdbfe25fdfe58cd95926d) from Pragmatic Programmers. It goes into greater detail about the agile process starting from inception to planning and execution.\n\nAgile methodology (you may also hear the term called scrum) has many flavors and each team tweaks it to come up with its own flavor. Here are the main events in Agile:\n\n### Inception\n\nOnce you go through the inception process, you’ll identify the roles, goals, and risks of the project. This process may take from several hours to several days for big projects. The outcome of inception is the backlog of items for the first iteration.\n\n### Planning\n\nThe first inception will serve as your first planning. That being said, you’ll need to get together with your team for a planning meeting at the beginning of every iteration to make sure everybody understands what needs to be done.\n\n### Daily Standup\n\nStandups are quick check-ins where you go around the room and everyone shares a status update. The goal is to track progress and identify blocking issues early.\n\n### Retrospective\n\nThis is one of the most important parts of Agile. The team gets together at the end of the iteration to discuss what worked, what didn’t so we can iterate on the process itself. Retrospective meetings are a safe place to express your thoughts so the team can improve.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUsing the right tool for the job is key. The Waterfall process is very different from Agile/Scrum. Which methodology is right for you is your choice. In some cases, it may be appropriate to go with a waterfall process if your product cycle is very long in your industry. For most of the tech startups, we recommend going with Agile since things move quickly requiring rapid innovation.\n\nOriginally posted on [alextamoykin.com](https://alextamoykin.com/why-throwing-more-features-at-the-product-doesnt-work \"Original post from Alex Tamoykin\")","dir":"/learn","path":"/learn/3-reasons-why-throwing-more-features-at-the-product-doesn-t-work","extension":".md","slug":"3-reasons-why-throwing-more-features-at-the-product-doesn-t-work","createdAt":"2023-08-11T17:54:04.126Z","updatedAt":"2023-08-11T17:54:04.126Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1691776578162},"$loki":13},{"draft":false,"tags":["management","career"],"related_content":[],"title":"5 Qualities of a 10x Engineer","short_title":"10x Engineer","header_one":"10x Engineer","header_two":"","header_three":"","cta_header":"Want a 10xer for your team?","cta_button":"","cta_href":"","icon":"weight-lifter","icons":[],"image_url":"","toc":[{"id":"overview","depth":2,"text":"Overview"},{"id":"what-makes-a-10x-er","depth":2,"text":"What Makes a 10x-er"},{"id":"self-sufficient","depth":3,"text":"Self-Sufficient"},{"id":"architect-systems","depth":3,"text":"Architect Systems"},{"id":"excited-for-a-challenge-bored-from-routine","depth":3,"text":"Excited For a Challenge, Bored from Routine"},{"id":"lead-by-example","depth":3,"text":"Lead by Example"},{"id":"always-hands-on","depth":3,"text":"Always Hands-On"},{"id":"conclusion","depth":2,"text":"Conclusion"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"overview"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#overview","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Overview"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"You most likely heard about a magical 10x engineer producing 10x more output than any other engineer in the company.

Knowing what technical debt is helps you work productively with software engineers. This post explains what technical debt is and how to manage it efficiently.\n\n## What is Technical Debt\n\nTechnical debt is similar to credit card debt. You can spend some extra money now with a credit card. If you won’t pay it back shortly, you’ll be charged interest. If you don’t pay it off for a long time, the amount you owe increases drastically. This decreases your credit score which is hard to recover from.\n\nTaking on technical debt in software product development is very similar to it. In order to accomplish a certain feature faster in the short term, a developer can apply a hack. If the hack is not replaced with a well-made out solution, the code around it decays over time. In addition to it, the software is built on top of other software. We all use libraries and operating systems. Technologies change and the system needs maintenance updates as time goes by, even if there are no new features being developed. If maintenance updates are not addressed, it also increases your technical debt.\n\n![Credit Card Debt](https://images.rightbalance.io/uploads/credit_cards.jpeg)\n\n## Why Taking on More Technical Debt Slows You Down\n\nAs you apply more hacks, your future development gets slower, you have more bugs in the product, and you get closer to the point when you need to start over. I’ve seen several companies in the past abandoning and rewriting their entire application from scratch since they were not able to make meaningful progress anymore.\n\n## How to Manage Technical Debt\n\n### Get on the same page with engineers and stakeholders\n\nIt’s crucially important for everyone on your engineering team and for stakeholders to understand the implications of endlessly taking on technical debt. Set up and maintain high code standards and [high test coverage](/solutions/automated-tests-get-dividends-with-every-test-run \"Automated testing solution\") on your engineering team. Make sure that stakeholders understand the technical debt concept and how it affects the speed and quality of the product. Aligning everyone’s expectations goes a long way.\n\n### Pay it off right after you introduced it\n\nEvery system has technical debt. Sometimes we need to focus on short-term goals. In this case, it's ok to introduce technical debt _if and only if_ you can pay it off right after you introduced it. The companies that ignore this important fact and continue to what seems like “moving quickly” will eventually slow down to a halt.\n\n### Revisit your architecture regularly\n\nWhat worked several months ago will not necessarily work now. Especially in startups where businesses grow and change fast, it’s important to revisit decisions made in the past. Take your time to refactor (or better yet, delete) code that no longer makes sense in order to accomplish the needs of today. Bring it up with your team as a part of your retrospectives and make action items to make sure it gets done.\n\n### Pay off big debt incrementally\n\nWhen dealing with legacy systems, it may be too big of a task for one engineer to refactor it. In this case, make a plan on how you want it to look and change it one piece at a time. It’s important to maintain the vision of what you want this legacy system to be at the end.\n\n### Leave the codebase in a better place than when you started\n\nAll that matters is if everyone makes incremental progress towards making the codebase better. It’s impractical to stop feature development to get rid of all technical debt. Maintaining the right balance between feature delivery and paying off technical debt is key.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEvery system out there has technical debt. Managing it effectively is a skill that can be learned. Technical debt is a risk. It's best to avoid risk and sometimes you have to take it. As long as the team is disciplined about paying it off, it's ok. At the end of the day, we all want to ship quality product, and managing technical debt is a part of it.\n\n_Photos are provided by_ [_p_valdivieso_](https://www.flickr.com/photos/p_valdivieso/) _and_ [_smemon_](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smemon)\n\nOriginally posted on [alextamoykin.com](https://alextamoykin.com/5-rules-of-managing-technical-debt-how-to-keep-moving-fast-today-and-tomorrow \"alextamoykin.com backlink\")","dir":"/learn","path":"/learn/5-rules-of-managing-technical-debt.how-to-keep-moving-fast-today-and-tomorrow","extension":".md","slug":"5-rules-of-managing-technical-debt.how-to-keep-moving-fast-today-and-tomorrow","createdAt":"2023-08-11T17:54:04.126Z","updatedAt":"2023-08-11T17:54:04.126Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1691776578175},"$loki":15},{"draft":false,"tags":["management","career","product"],"related_content":[],"title":"Build For Scale, Build to Last: 10 Steps to Build a Long Lasting Product","short_title":"Build For Scale, Build to Last","header_one":"Build For Scale","header_two":"Build to Last","header_three":"","cta_header":"Want to build something impactful?","cta_button":"","cta_href":"","icon":"trending-up","icons":[],"image_url":"","toc":[{"id":"building-things-right-makes-everything-else-easier","depth":2,"text":"Building things right makes everything else easier"},{"id":"1-achieve-company-alignment","depth":2,"text":"1.

Because coding requires you to deal with a lot of variables, it takes some time to get into the context (what some people call getting into the zone). Switching to a manual task, like updating some records in the database, requires you to switch your context. Then once the task is done, coming back to coding will take some time again because you need to get into another, more complicated context of coding. If you have several manual tasks spread throughout the day, you’ll find yourself not producing any meaningful code by the end of the day.

Here is a link to the [Serverless Microservices solution](/solutions/serverless-software-development-focus-on-features-instead-of-the-infrastructure \"Serverless Microservices solution\") going deeper on the topic.\n\nIn the meantime, let’s go over the 10 ways to build a long-lasting product:\n\n## 1. Achieve Company Alignment\n\nIt’s important to have a buy-in from the whole organization that rushing through and shipping low-quality product is counterproductive. Each shortcut we take will add on to our technical debt which needs to be paid off. On the other hand, there should always be urgency around shipping because it’s easy to fall into a trap of building a perfect product for a long time. The best code is worthless if it’s not shipped and running in production without any issues. It’s all about finding [the right balance](https://rightbalance.io) (no pun intended).\n\n## 2. Minimize System Downtime\n\nAs software engineers, we should strive to build computer systems that are always up and serving our customers without our manual intervention. Why? Because it’s in the nature of our profession and in the core strength of the whole of humankind to build systems that work without requiring our presence. While developing a software component, engineers should always be focused on developing it in a way so it can deliver customer value and recover gracefully from an error situation. Which involves performing validation on the incoming data, making sure there are self-healing automated systems in place. And if the error happens, it’s clear what to do, appropriate people are notified for taking care of the issue.\n\n## 3. Minimize Maintenance\n\nDoing things right is hard and it takes time. However, if you commit to doing things right, then eventually, doing things right becomes second nature. In addition to it, doing things right becomes easier the more you do it. So, if there is a question when you should start doing things right, the answer is now. It’s very easy to fall into a trap of introducing a couple of manual steps in your deployment or some SQL you need to run sometimes to clean up your data. The goal is to reduce the number of manual steps engineers need to do instead of adding more manual steps. Each maintenance step you add may not seem like a lot. It’s a slippery slope that turns software engineers into maintenance engineers. We’ve seen the entire engineering team not producing any more new code and just doing some manual tasks to keep the product running. Unfortunately, it’s quite common, especially in large organizations. All high maintenance systems start with just one manual step you leave behind.\n\n## 4. Automate Manual Work\n\nThe best use of a software developer’s time is to create systems that deliver value. Coding is hard and there are only so many hours in a day. So it’s best to apply our coding skills towards automating some manual work we otherwise need to do. Another issue with manual work is that it requires a context switch. Because coding requires you to deal with a lot of variables, it takes some time to get into the context (what some people call getting into the zone). Switching to a manual task, like updating some records in the database, requires you to switch your context. Then once the task is done, coming back to coding will take some time again because you need to get into another, more complicated context of coding. If you have several manual tasks spread throughout the day, you’ll find yourself not producing any meaningful code by the end of the day. That said, doing some manual work once in a while is unavoidable. The solution is to strive to minimize it and automate it away instead of adding to it.\n\n## 5. Keep your hand on the pulse with Alerting and Monitoring\n\nEach microservice or a client application has to have some alerting and monitoring component before going live. Your component may work on your local machine or even in the hands of a QA person. Once it goes live, the only way to know if it works as expected after you deploy your changes is to have some comprehensive alerting and monitoring. If an error happens, it should be sent to email/text/slack/PagerDuty or anywhere it can be seen and acted upon. The goal of it is to not create more distractions or more manual work, but rather to find if we missed something that should be added as a feature or an improvement to the product. As long as you keep on improving and refactoring your system, you’ll one day come to a place where things just work, always.\n\n## 6. Measure and Analyze\n\n> _If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it._\n>\n> * _Peter Drucker_\n\nTrusting your gut is important, that said, business decisions need to be made based on some real data. Our recommendation is to target a specific set of metrics for the product, collect the data, and monitor the metrics closely with some regular analysis. Some of the metrics can be collected from the client application like button clicks, page views, etc. And some need to be collected from the back end. The best solution is to have a proper [data warehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse) or [data lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake) where all sources of data come together in a structured format you can query. This allows you to connect the dots and build conversion funnels based on the rich set of data.\n\n## 7. Document instead of Keeping Things in Your Head\n\nHaving the system knowledge only in someone's head is risky. It decreases your [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor). If the knowledge is spread out then having to talk to multiple people to understand how the system works is inefficient. It also slows down your team velocity in the long run. The solution to this problem is simple. You choose your documentation tool ([Quip](http://quip.com), [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence), or even [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/) work just fine) and you make it a good practice to document how each part of the system works. Once the modification to the system is made, the documentation needs to be updated too. This way, there is a consistent process for ramping up new developers on any part of your system. New developers just read the existing docs and make the updates as necessary.\n\n## 8. Minimize Management Overhead\n\nIt’s amazing to see how a lot of open source projects streamline the process for reporting issues, implementing the fixes, and rolling out new releases. The same principles should apply within your organization too. The key to minimizing management overhead is to have a solid feature delivery process (preferably Agile) that everyone believes and follows. Things like introducing more changes mid-sprint create additional scope-related conversations, change of context, sometimes misaligned expectations. It takes energy to address them, and this energy could be spent on delivering the functionality by sticking to the plan.\n\n## 9. Maximize Maker Time\n\nMaker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule article from [Paul Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)), one of the founders of [YCombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) describes the difference between how the maker operates and the manager operates. It’s important to realize that your product is built by makers. Software engineering is hard and it consumes a lot of brain energy. To make a great product, it takes some time to get into the zone. And if a developer gets constantly dragged into some side conversations and meetings, getting into the zone is almost impossible. Maximizing maker time, removing the meetings and distractions from your developers is key to having a high velocity on your team.\n\n## 10. Have Fun!\n\nSoftware engineering is a creative process. Any creative process requires having fun, having high energy fueled by enjoying what you’re doing. Just cranking through some boring work isn’t going to get your team very far in the long run. Doing things so it’s exciting, using the latest technologies, solving problems in new and creative ways is what makes the products great. If things get boring, think about how you can spice things up using the new tech, features, or product opportunities. You’ll get a highly motivated team having a lot of fun!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere is no time to waste building your product. Everything you build today can last decades and affect millions of people. When the basics are done right, scaling your product is easy. It lowers your maintenance costs so you can focus on future growth and development. Doing so requires some effort upfront which is totally worth it.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Go ahead and build something that scales and lasts! 🙌","dir":"/learn","path":"/learn/build-for-scale-build-to-last-10-steps-to-build-a-long-lasting-product","extension":".md","slug":"build-for-scale-build-to-last-10-steps-to-build-a-long-lasting-product","createdAt":"2023-08-11T17:54:04.126Z","updatedAt":"2023-08-11T17:54:04.126Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1691776578191},"$loki":16},{"tags":["hiring","management"],"related_content":[],"title":"How to Hire Best People","short_title":"Hire Best People","header_one":"Hire Best People","icon":"trophy","cta_header":"Need help hiring software engineers?","toc":[{"id":"where-to-find-the-best-people","depth":2,"text":"Where to find the best people"},{"id":"referrals","depth":3,"text":"Referrals"},{"id":"recruiters","depth":3,"text":"Recruiters"},{"id":"diy-search","depth":3,"text":"DIY Search"},{"id":"contractors","depth":3,"text":"Contractors"},{"id":"interview","depth":2,"text":"Interview"},{"id":"hire","depth":2,"text":"Hire"},{"id":"final-thoughts","depth":2,"text":"Final Thoughts"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"blockquote","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and then tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Steve Jobs"}]}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Hiring the best people is at the core of every successful organization.

Software engineers only write application code, the QA team tests the developed product. Once a new release is developed under phase 1, the software goes to the QA team. The QA team executes manual tests by going through the user interface and making sure the product works right in phase 2. If a bug is found in phase 3, the QA team tells the development team how to reproduce the bug. Sometimes a product manager is involved to prioritize bug fixes to go in certain releases. As you can see, it’s a complex process involving communication between developers and QA engineers on a regular basis. In addition to it, there are only so many manual tests that a human can execute per day.\n\n### **Manual QA doesn’t scale well**\n\nAs mentioned previously, what happens after you develop more features, a number of manual tests increases and teams usually make one of the following decisions. They either hire more QA staff or execute fewer tests. Unfortunately, most of the companies I’ve seen go with the second approach which causes bugs, loss of customers, and lost revenue.\n\nThere is another way, have computers execute tests for you.\n\n## What are automated tests\n\nWhen you write a piece of software, you want to make sure it works correctly. Let’s say, you implemented a login screen in your mobile app. After you’re done with your task, you may go ahead, stand up the app and try logging into the system. After you move on to the next feature, you test the next feature in a similar way. As you develop more features, you can’t possibly test all features you developed to date. It will simply take you too much time to test every feature manually every time you change the code. What ends up happening is that you break previously developed functionality without even realizing it.\n\nThat’s where [automated tests](/solutions/automated-tests-get-dividends-with-every-test-run \"Automated testing solution\") come in. An automated test is a piece of code that executes a test. You write it once and execute it with one command any number of times you want. In the example of the login screen, you write a test that stands up the app and taps into a field with an invisible finger, enters some information, and checks that the user is successfully logged in.\n\n![](https://images.rightbalance.io/uploads/development_cycle_with_automated_qa.png)\n\nAs you can see from the following diagram, all 3 steps of software development happen during the same development phase. It involves fewer people, lowers communication overhead, and increases quality (computers are more consistent at running tests than humans).\n\n## How to automate your tests\n\n### Product Managers to provide clear requirements\n\nDeveloping and trying to automate an undefined product is very expensive. If requirements constantly change, both, the application code and automated tests need to be constantly rewritten. In addition to it, it’s tough to identify the best testing strategy if you don’t know what kind of product you’re building. Make sure your product manager provides clear acceptance criteria for every user story.\n\n### Engineers write unit and integration tests\n\nThe problem with a manual test is that you need to have a human executing it every single time which is expensive. If you automate your test, you spend a little more effort upfront by writing it. Then, you have your [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) servers running tests for you as many times and as often as you would like.\n\n### Don’t automate every single thing\n\nIt’s a delicate balance between what makes sense to automate and what doesn’t. You have to compare time cost vs benefit. In some cases, an integration test gives you the most bang for the buck. In some cases, it’s easier to test an isolated piece of logic with a unit test instead.\n\n### QA engineers test interactions between systems\n\nIf your product consists of multiple systems (like a mobile front end, a web front end, multiple back-end services, etc), it’s important to test all pieces working together. Software engineers make sure every system is functioning correctly. However, it doesn’t really matter if each piece works as expected if the system as a whole doesn’t work. Cross-functional tests are the toughest to write. Make sure you automate the tests you execute most often manually first to be more efficient.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAutomated tests are a great way to increase quality and iterate faster. If you keep your tests healthy, you can ship your software to production at any time. It allows you to move quicker, iterate and learn faster. Writing automated tests is an important skill for every software engineer. It takes some time to develop and it pays off big time. Every system is different. That’s why you need to constantly challenge yourself with writing fewer tests that cover more functionality.\n\nOriginally posted on [alextamoykin.com](https://alextamoykin.com/how-to-reduce-manual-qa-increase-quality-of-your-product-and-iterate-faster \"Original post from Alex Tamoykin\")","dir":"/learn","path":"/learn/how-to-reduce-manual-qa-increase-product-quality-and-iterate-faster","extension":".md","slug":"how-to-reduce-manual-qa-increase-product-quality-and-iterate-faster","createdAt":"2023-08-11T17:54:04.126Z","updatedAt":"2023-08-11T17:54:04.126Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1691776578223},"$loki":19},{"draft":false,"tags":["hiring","management"],"related_content":[],"title":"How to start a new project when all your developers are busy","short_title":"Start new project","header_one":"Start New Project","header_two":"When all your devs are busy","header_three":"","cta_header":"Need developers for your new project?","cta_button":"","cta_href":"","icon":"play-circle-outline","icons":[],"image_url":"","toc":[{"id":"time-is-of-the-essence","depth":2,"text":"Time is of the essence"},{"id":"how-to-bring-new-engineering-resources-quickly","depth":2,"text":"How to bring new engineering resources quickly"},{"id":"build-vs-buy","depth":3,"text":"Build vs Buy"},{"id":"outsource","depth":3,"text":"Outsource"},{"id":"staff-augmentation","depth":3,"text":"Staff Augmentation"},{"id":"conclusion","depth":2,"text":"Conclusion"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"time-is-of-the-essence"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#time-is-of-the-essence","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Time is of the essence"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"You would like to launch a new feature or a new product in your organization.

In some industries like factory manufacturing, it’s the only option. That said, with the current state of technology and especially for thought workers like software engineers, it’s no longer a requirement. With a high-performance laptop and an Internet connection, you can work from anywhere in the world, including your home office. Remote workforce unlocks limitless possibilities for your business like getting access to a larger and more cost-efficient pool of talent internationally. Especially in the pandemic, when going into an office is complicated, there is no reason for not taking the advantage of global remote work opportunities.\n\n## Why Remote is Great\n\n### Big Companies Go Remote\n\nLarge companies like [Github](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/teams/collaborating-at-github-with-a-60--remote-workforce) (bought by Microsoft), [InVision](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-InVision-EI_IE912781.11,19.htm), [37signals](https://37signals.com/) (makers of [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) and creators of [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)) were already operating remotely even before the pandemic. There are books written on a subject like [Remote](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804137501/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0804137501&linkCode=as2&tag=howtoprogramb-20&linkId=7975a9b05dc299f15f7e104f0228bebc).\n\n<a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804137501/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0804137501&linkCode=as2&tag=howtoprogramb-20&linkId=611578c3e043dbf86bd8a76ef379fdab\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=0804137501&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=howtoprogramb-20\" ></a><img src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=howtoprogramb-20&l=am2&o=1&a=0804137501\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />\n\n### Remote is here to stay\n\nEspecially in the pandemic, remote work is the new norm. Per [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/tech-companies-are-looking-at-more-flexible-work-models-when-offices-reopen/): even when the offices reopen, companies are looking at flexible work models.\n\n### Larger pool of more cost-effective talent\n\nThe remote workforce unlocks the possibility of hiring people outside of your city and even your country. You can have a truly international team of professionals working in lockstep with you.\n\nNeedless to say, due to the cost of living difference between the United States and the rest of the world, you’ll get some amazingly skilled and motivated professionals at the fraction of the cost of a local US employee. No need to worry about immigration either. Remote workers can be hired as individual contractors through a contracting company reducing the complexity of your payroll.\n\nWith remote, you’re tapping into a larger pool of talent than in your local city. It’s especially helpful if you’re looking to fulfill multiple roles at your company and the local job market is very competitive.\n\nWorth noting that in some countries, higher education is more accessible and less costly than in the US. So yes, you can hire a remote worker who actually knows how software algorithms and data structures work ;-)\n\n### More Productivity and Focus\n\nWorking at the office, especially with an open floor plan, can be distracting. It’s very easy to spend your entire day between meetings, random conversations with your peers, especially with the hard work requiring a high amount of mental energy and concentration like software engineering.\n\nWorking remotely solves this problem. With a properly set up personal office, there are fewer distractions, leaving more time for individual contributions. A book on a subject is my all-time favorite: [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455586692/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1455586692&linkCode=as2&tag=howtoprogramb-20&linkId=46b086be5569689988b467402a54c7ce): Rules for Focused Success In a Distracted World.\n\n<a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455586692/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1455586692&linkCode=as2&tag=howtoprogramb-20&linkId=06538a88eefeffef43601d0cf77295db\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=1455586692&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=howtoprogramb-20\" ></a><img src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=howtoprogramb-20&l=am2&o=1&a=1455586692\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />\n\n## How To Work With a Remote Team\n\n### Timezone\n\nThe key to managing distributed teams is maintaining the concept of Core Hours. Core hours is when everyone, regardless of the local time zone are available for cross-team communication and meetings. For example, if you’re in the US and you have people in multiple geographic regions like Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Asia, then all of them should be available during your core hours, usually between your morning and noon. People located in the timezone with more proximity (for example US and Latin America) will have more overlap with your team.\n\n### Video Calls\n\nRegular meetings like standups, sprint plannings, retrospectives, debugging sessions can happen over video calls. The most popular options are [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), [GoToMeeting](https://www.gotomeeting.com/), [Google Meet](https://gsuite.google.com/products/meet/). Most of the video conferencing software allows you to add multiple attendees, share your camera and your screen. It’s especially useful if you would like to walk your team through a presentation. If you have an issue you need some help with, you can have a video call with your remote co-worker to troubleshoot it over a screen sharing session.\n\n### Messaging / Chat\n\nWith the evolution of messaging software, it’s now more efficient to communicate over messaging than talking to a large group. The advantages of using messaging for your communication are that it’s searchable, can be referred to later on, and it works for communicating with your entire team regardless of the physical location of your team members. Most notable options are [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software), [HipChat](https://www.atlassian.com/software/hipchat/downloads).\n\n### Tracking Progress\n\nYou most likely already use these tools to track your projects. [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Asana](http://asana.com), [Monday](https://monday.com/) or a good old school spreadsheet (yes, people still do it, and it works great!) are available to track your team’s progress. Remote team members are assigned some tickets to work on. Once the work is started, the ticket is moved to in progress, then in QA, and to done. All steps along the way you’ll know exactly who works on what and when the work is ready to be reviewed.\n\n### Pushing Code\n\nChances are that you’re already using these tools too. There is no need to host a private git repository on your secret server in a closet. Services like [Github](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) are available for your team. You can set the individual permissions for each code repository and assign different permissions to your engineers as you see fit. All code gets pushed to the same repository. Remote workers will follow your standard code review procedure using the same code standards that you already have.\n\n### Testing\n\nStopping by at your developer’s desk to see the progress is inefficient and distractive. So you should be already using services like [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/app-distribution) to distribute your test builds for your mobile app. The websites are deployed to your QA or staging environment for testing which you can access from your web browser. You can check the database with your database client like [Sequel Pro](https://www.sequelpro.com/) or [Navicat](https://www.navicat.com/). Your API can be tested with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). And your cloud is easy to manage using [Commandeer](https://getcommandeer.com/).\n\n### Security\n\nSecurity is the top priority for remote workers. At [Right Balance](https://rightbalance.io/), we follow the best security practices like using [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network), [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) keys, hard disk encryption, being able to erase a laptop remotely, and more.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith the current state of technology, remote workers enable your business to achieve greater heights. And as you can see, it’s not that different from your current way of working anyway. There is no reason for not taking advantage of a larger pool of high-quality talent in timezone-friendly regions like Latin America and Eastern Europe. In addition to it, due to a lower cost of living, remote workers are more cost-efficient, as well as more motivated to work with an international team.\n\nOriginally posted at [alextamoykin.com](https://alextamoykin.com/unlock-the-power-of-remote-workforce-for-your-business)","dir":"/learn","path":"/learn/unlock-the-power-of-the-global-remote-workforce-for-your-business","extension":".md","slug":"unlock-the-power-of-the-global-remote-workforce-for-your-business","createdAt":"2023-08-11T17:54:04.126Z","updatedAt":"2023-08-11T17:54:04.126Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1691776578252},"$loki":22},{"tags":["hiring","management"],"related_content":[],"title":"Why Hiring Senior Engineers is Hard And How to Solve It","short_title":"Why hiring engineers is hard","header_two":"Why Hiring Senior Engineers","header_three":"is Hard","icon":"star","cta_header":"Need help hiring senior engineers?","toc":[{"id":"overview","depth":2,"text":"Overview"},{"id":"why-hiring-is-hard","depth":2,"text":"Why Hiring Is Hard"},{"id":"how-to-solve-engineering-deficit","depth":2,"text":"How To Solve Engineering Deficit"},{"id":"growing-existing-talent","depth":3,"text":"Growing Existing Talent"},{"id":"hiring-junior-engineers-or-interns","depth":3,"text":"Hiring Junior Engineers or Interns"},{"id":"contractors","depth":3,"text":"Contractors"},{"id":"contract-to-hire","depth":3,"text":"Contract to hire"},{"id":"final-thoughts","depth":2,"text":"Final Thoughts"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"overview"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#overview","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Overview"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"If you're in an engineering leadership position like Engineering Manager, Director, VP, CTO, one of your main responsibilities is to grow your engineering team.

If your API is architected well, everything else comes together naturally. Your product will be able to support your level of traffic and you’ll have a lot of happy customers.\n\nWhen designing your API, you’ll need to minimize the following:\n\n1.

With the increase in traffic comes the increase in cost. Therefore, when building your backend, you should be aware of the cost implications of your implementation decisions. We recommend focusing on the following areas:\n\n#### Keeping your operational database slim\n\nThe main purpose of your operational database is to serve the immediate API requests. Anything else adds to the database size, decreases the database availability, and makes scaling the database harder, especially for SQL databases.\n\n#### Keeping your non-production environments small\n\nDepending on your use-case, you’ll need a number of different environments.

There are solutions made specifically for each type of problem to solve. Logs can be archived into some flat files and processed offline. There are plenty of search solutions like [Elastic Search](https://www.elastic.co/ \"Elastic Search page\") or [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/ \"Algolia Website\"). A data warehouse needs to be separate from your runtime operational database so your data analyst doesn’t bring your runtime system down. Plus data warehouse users need the data in a different format. When using the right solution for each type of problem, you’ll be able to provide a better experience for the users. You’ll also have better control over your system cost.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYour backend infrastructure is the heart of your system. It supports your client applications at scale.

What makes testing easier is structuring your code in a modular way. Modularizing your architecture allows you to swap out or refactor each module in isolation without affecting the rest of the system.\n\nIn addition to your code being modular, your code will also be more robust.

Automated tests help exercise all code paths involved so you can focus on the task at hand as opposed to constantly retesting the entire system and hypothesizing where it can break.\n\n### Tests are Your Documentation\n\nTests document the existing behavior of your system. When structured correctly, and especially with the use of [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development#:\\~:text=In%20software%20engineering%2C%20behavior%2Ddriven,participants%20in%20a%20software%20project. \"Behavior Driven Development\") syntax, your tests are your system documentation. You can use it to ramp up new engineers as well as a reference for how your system works in practice.\n\n### Tests Prove That Your System Works\n\nThe code you write may be the greatest code ever and you may think it works. That being said, you never know if it actually works until it’s in production serving real customers. A green test suite is proof of your code working as expected as opposed to a guess or a good feeling that your system will work.\n\n### Get Dividends With Each Test Run\n\nWriting automated tests is an investment that pays dividends with every test run.

We recommend creating a robust [CI/CD pipeline](/solutions/ci-cd-like-ac-dc-rock-n-roll-with-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery) which runs before merging your feature branches and when you deploy your code.\n\n### Load Tests\n\nAs the name suggests, load tests test your system under load. There are numerous tools available starting from a simple CLI tool like [Apache Benchmark](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html \"Apache Benchmark Overview\") to more sophisticated solutions with a GUI like [jMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/ \"jMeter\") or [Locust](https://locust.io/ \"Locust\").

If you don’t have a test suite running, getting it to run and putting it on CI is the first step. There are several ways to give the team visibility into the health of your automated tests. You can enable CI notifications about the failed builds to go to Slack. Another helpful technique is exposing the CI status as a dashboard on a TV in the office.

You get the proof that your system works as expected with every run. Adding more test cases to your system has a cumulative effect since you get the dividends with every run of your test suite. If writing automated tests is something new for your team, or you would like to improve your testing setup, don’t hesitate to reach out.

We’ve several different branching strategies like [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ \"Git flow branching strategy\"). All of the strategies have one thing in common. There is a single mainline development branch. Each developer creates his/her own branch of the mainline and works independently on a feature.

Client-side development is centered around developing client-side applications. Mobile applications, websites, desktop apps are all examples of a client-side application. When your users interact with your product, the only thing they see is your client-side user interface. That’s why building your client-side applications right is crucial to deliver an enlightening user experience.\n\n## Client-Side Application Architecture\n\nA typical client-side application consists of the following main components:\n\n### User Interface\n\nAll visual elements like buttons, different color backgrounds, images, etc, and most of the interactions between them are your user interface. At this level, you’ll work primarily with the layout frameworks like [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit) / [Swift UI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/ \"Swift UI framework from Apple\") for iOS, your favorite Javascript and CSS framework for your web application like [React](https://reactjs.org/ \"React JS Framework\"), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/ \"Vue JS Framework\"), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/ \"Svelte\"), etc.\n\nAll code powering your UI runs in the main thread of the application. The main thread is the thread responsible for rendering your UI. You want to be mindful of the operations you perform on the main thread. Heavy work should be offloaded to the background thread instead. This way the UI stays responsive and the users have some great user experience even if there is some heavy work happening in the background at the same time.\n\n### Networking Layer\n\nThe networking layer’s main purpose is to fetch and save the data to the [Backend API](/solutions/api-development-scale-to-millions-of-users-with-a-robust-backend). This layer performs the actual network requests, parses the data coming from the API. Last but not least, it saves the parsed data into the Data Store Layer in the shape the application expects it.\n\n### Data Store\n\nThe datastore layer is responsible for storing and persisting the data on the client (either in memory or on disk). UI layer gets its data from the store as it changes. The networking layer updates the data in the store as it comes from the API. This way both the UI layer and the networking layer are abstracted and decoupled from each other and can be developed independently.\n\n[CoreData](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/index.html \"CoreData framework\") on iOS, [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/ \"Vuex - a reactive store for Vue.js\") for Vue.js, [Redux](https://redux.js.org/ \"Store for React\") for React, are all examples of a data store for your client-side application.\n\n## Focus areas\n\nBecause your client-side applications’ main function is to interact directly with the user, the primary focus is on the following areas.\n\n### Look and Feel\n\nYour users will be using your UI every single time they interact with your product. That’s why it’s important to have a beautiful, aesthetically pleasing design for your app. When you hold the phone with your application in your hands, or when you have it on the screen of your desktop computer, you should wow over how great the look and feel is. The elements should be clearly positioned on the screen, the user should be able to navigate to each part of the app effortlessly. Adding subtle animations to some UI elements where needed makes the application UI really pop.\n\n### Performance\n\nYour client-side application runs on a device with some limited resources. That’s why the performance is so important because you don’t have the infinitely scalable capacity like you have on the backend. The key here is to offload all heavy work from the main thread to the background thread. Being mindful of your memory usage and your disk usage goes a long way.\n\n### Resiliency\n\nYour backend server is always plugged into the outlet and has access to the Internet. Unfortunately, it’s not the case with client-side devices. Your user's phone or a laptop can lose Internet connectivity at any time, run out of a battery, or even run out of memory since the capacity is limited. Client-side operating systems are very aggressive with freeing up precious resources. On Android or iOS, your app can be just killed by the operating system at any time when your app is in the background. In addition to it, your app should never crash at all costs. An app crash has a massively negative impact on your user growth and retention. While implementing your features on the client, lean on the safe side, write a lot of safeguards and null checks. Save your data locally or on the server so you can pick up where you left off in case the user quits the app and opens it at a later time.\n\n## Automated Testing and CI/CD\n\nWriting tests on the client is very straightforward at the networking level. You’ll be able to write some good unit tests which are fast to execute. On another hand, UI testing is more complicated, less flexible, and that’s where you get the most coverage and benefit. That’s why we recommend writing most of the unit tests at the networking level and writing a few UI tests for the major flows in the app. While writing UI tests, it’s important to keep in mind that some elements can appear on the screen with some delays. In addition to it, it’s best to mock the network calls to avoid some unexpected test failures due to network latency.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that there are many variations of client devices, browsers, and operating systems. We recommend running your automated and manual tests on the farm of devices. [AWS Device Farm](https://aws.amazon.com/device-farm/ \"AWS Device Farm overview\"), [Firebase Test Lab](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab \"Firebase Test Lab page\"), [Cross Browser Testing](https://crossbrowsertesting.com/ \"Cross Browser Testing Page\"), or [Browser Stack](https://www.browserstack.com/ \"Browser Stack page\") are all great solutions you can use to solve this problem.\n\nYour CI/CD pipeline should be capable of testing and building your apps for testing and distribution. We recommend [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/ \"TestFlight overview\") for iOS, [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-distribution \"Firebase page\") for Android. For your web and desktop applications, you can use your internal test environment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs you can see, client-side development is a different beast from your backend or infrastructure development. With the main focus on look and feel, your app’s mission is to deliver the best user experience possible for the user while using the limited resources efficiently on the device. Due to the wide number of combinations of client devices and operating systems, it’s best to equip yourself with some cross-platform testing tools.

You deploy your code and your cloud provider manages the servers for you under the hood. It allows you to focus on your code minimizing the amount of effort spent on the infrastructure.\n\n## Why Serverless Matters\n\n### Pay per use\n\nNo need to pay for idle servers. With Serverless, you only pay for the time it takes to run your application. If you aren’t using your system, you don’t incur any runtime costs. It’s ideal for your development, staging, and QA environments which aren’t used 24/7.\n\n### All major cloud providers support Serverless\n\n[Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/), [Google GCP](https://cloud.google.com/serverless), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/serverless/), and many more providers support Serverless technology. Most of them continue to integrate Serverless further into more of their products. We’re already seeing [Amazon Aurora Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/) database and [Fargate Container](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) engine following the same Serverless principles of paying for only when the resources are used. Serverless is entering the mainstream phase now. There are plenty of resources and libraries online to help you.\n\n<img\nalt=\"Cloud Providers\"\nclass=\"left\"\nsrc=\"https://images.rightbalance.io/uploads/cloud-providers.svg\"\n/>\n\n### Infinitely Scalable\n\nServerless resources grow and shrink automatically with your demand. More Serverless resources are spawned up when more requests are coming. If there are no requests at all, no resources are running.\n\n### Be At the Forefront of Technology\n\nRunning on your own hardware is complicated and unnecessary (unless you’re at a scale of Google or Amazon), so as running on dedicated virtualized servers (like [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)). Over the next 5 years, Serverless will become the norm and a default choice for new development. Working with new technology is exciting for you and your team! Don’t miss the opportunity to be ahead of the game instead of playing catch up.\n\n## Business Problems Serverless Solves\n\n### Power your Websites, Mobile Apps, and IoT Devices\n\nServerless functions plugs in directly into your API Gateway or GraphQL endpoints. This means they can power your client applications like mobile apps, websites, IoT devices, and the rest of the backend microservices.\n\n### Deliver relevant data to stakeholders\n\nIn our day and age, having access to the relevant data is everything. It’s very straightforward to connect your serverless function to a queue, a pub-sub system, a database or even your file storage bucket. In the case of AWS, all of the major data services like [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/), [SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) all support the ability to trigger a serverless function to take the data that just arrived, transform it and deliver it to some relevant parties. No need to build some brutal long-running ETL jobs introducing some update delays. Process the data as it comes in, and deliver it to your data warehouse close to real-time.\n\n### Reduce Infrastructure Cost\n\nNo need to pay for your servers sitting around doing no work, right? Same for your database, if it’s not being used in your QA environment overnight, why pay for it? By moving more and more resources to Serverless, you reduce your costs and make your CFO happy 💸\n\n### Increase Development Velocity\n\nBusiness opportunities come and go quickly. Being able to develop your software fast, deploy it, and have it run automatically is key for growing your business. Serverless technology allows you to do exactly that. Just focus on your features and let your cloud provider take care of the infrastructure for you.\n\n### Handle Traffic Spikes Seamlessly\n\nEver got a notification about your servers going down because of a marketing campaign bringing more traffic? With a well-architected Serverless system, with all bottlenecks removed (or moved to Serverless) you’ll be able to support any unexpected spike in traffic. With more traffic coming to the system, more serverless functions are spawned up to support the increasing demand. And when the traffic is tailing off, fewer serverless functions are invoked to keep your system cost-effective.\n\n<h2 id=\"solution\" class=\"heading\">Solution</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"strong-architecture\" class=\"subheading\">Strong Architecture</h3>\n\nPutting together some solid architecture goes a long way.

Our goal is to help all users understand how everyone “stacks up” without having to parse individual resumes or LinkedIn profiles and ask for referrals or recommendations.\n\nOur company has raised $26M to date–-although we are still pre-product.

WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?**\n\n**_In Short:_** _We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests._\n\n**_If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you._**\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:\n\n* **Consent.** We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click [here](#withdrawconsent) to learn more.\n* **Performance of a Contract.** We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.\n* **Legitimate Interests.** We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms.

You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click [here](#withdrawconsent) to learn more.\n\nIn some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:\n\n* If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way\n* For investigations and fraud detection and prevention\n* For business transactions provided certain conditions are met\n* If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim\n* For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin\n* If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse\n* If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province\n* If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records\n* If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced\n* If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes\n* If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations\n\n## **4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?**\n\n**_In Short:_** _We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties._\n\nWe may need to share your personal information in the following situations:\n\n* **Business Transfers.** We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.\n* **Affiliates.** We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will require those affiliates to honor this privacy notice.

If you interact with other users of our Services and register for our Services through a social network (such as Facebook), your contacts on the social network will see your name, profile photo, and descriptions of your activity.

HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?**\n\n**_In Short:_** _If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you._\n\nOur Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.\n\nWe will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.\n\n## **7. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?**\n\n**_In Short:_** _We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own._\n\nOur servers are located in the United States. If you are accessing our Services from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see \"[WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?](#whoshare)\" above), in the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Costa Rica, and other countries.\n\nIf you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK), then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.\n\nEuropean Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses:\n\nWe have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request.

No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.\n\nWhen we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.\n\n## **9. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?**\n\n**_In Short:_** _We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures._\n\nWe have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
