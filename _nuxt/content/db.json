It brings consistency and encourages building a robust set of automated tests as a long-lasting investment into your system.\n\n<h2 id=\"execution\" class=\"heading\">Execution</h2>\n\nRight Balance team and Edmodo staff work together to attack the current challenges on multiple fronts.\n\n<h3 id=\"daily-releases\" class=\"subheading\">From Weekly to Daily Releases</h3>\n\nWith the goal set to be able to release any day, Right Balance worked together with multiple department heads from Edmodo to design, implement, and provide training for existing personnel on a new way of releasing daily.\n\n#### Process\n\nThe current process was cutting a release tag by the end of the week, running the acceptance tests over the weekend, fixing issues at the beginning of the next week, and releasing mid-week. The first change was to move the test running from the weekend into the week so the team has a weekend to recharge. The next step was to introduce the automatic deployment of any new changes coming into the mainline git branch, followed by the run of the acceptance test suite. All of which used to happen only once a week for multiple features in the release.\n\n#### Infrastructure\n\nPartnering with a stellar DevOps accelerator called [CloudPosse](http://cloudposse.com/), Right Balance produced a state of the art [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) infrastructure created with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and the rest of [CloudPosse’s Open Source cloud tools](https://github.com/cloudposse). Once the main runway was put together, each backend application was migrated over to the new runway gaining some amazing consistency for services configuration and provisioning. In addition to it, comprehensive monitoring was put in place, as well as auto-scaling elasticity, and the version control for the infrastructure templates.\n\n#### CI/CD\n\nEdmodo acceptance test suite has some great test coverage. That said, with the absence of mocking and with the growing number of edge cases to test, the suite quickly grew into 880 feature scenarios running for 1.5 hours with some mixed results. To speed up the existing acceptance tests and to make the test more robust, we introduced API level tests.\n\nWe took the existing end to end tests written in [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) and [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/), and split them into two groups of tests:\n\n1. API level tests using [Postman](http://getpostman.com/)\n2. Mocked UI tests using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)\n\nIt allows us to offload the existing Cucumber test suite and eventually migrate it towards the new stack with Postman and Cypress. In addition to it, running mocked UI tests became a lot faster. Which in turn enabled the QA team to write more precise tests covering some additional corner cases.\n\n<h3 id=\"track-analyze-reduce-aws-spent\" class=\"subheading\">Track, Analyze, and Reduce AWS Spent</h3>\n\nWe went from $650,000 a month down to $300,000 a month. How is it possible? The key is to have hard numbers that you can analyze and keep track of keeping your AWS as low as possible.\n\nFirst things first, we did a full inventory audit of the existing infrastructure including server instances, databases, buckets, etc. Next, we created a cost dashboard using [AWS QuickSight](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/). This way we can track and visualize the AWS spent.\n\nEquipped with some hard numbers, we created a battle plan to remove the unnecessary resources, downscale some overscaled resources, introduce elasticity to the picture using [Aurora Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/) and the rest of the [Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) technologies. Last but not least, we added some application-level caching reducing the load on the databases, hence lowering down database instance size.\n\n<h3 id=\"build-vs-buy\" class=\"subheading\">Build vs Buy</h3>\n\nA build vs buy decision always comes down to using your core competency as the competitive advantage. After doing an audit of the internal systems, we found out several homegrown systems that can be completely eliminated with the use of modern technologies and external services. The homegrown search was replaced by [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/). So as the homegrown CI was easily replaced with [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Doing so lowered the AWS bill, reduced the amount of maintenance overhead for the engineering team, and allowed Edmodo to use some well-known solutions in the industry.\n\n<h2 id=\"results\" class=\"heading\">Results</h2>\n\nEdmodo’s mission is impactful and inspiring. With a strong company culture, people are passionate about what they do. They work together towards a common goal: bringing accessible education to the masses. Right Balance engagement took Edmodo technology and process to the next level.\n\nModernization of the Edmodo tech stack led to a $350,000 monthly reduction in AWS bill, 30% decrease in maintenance overhead for existing systems, simple to understand architecture using the modern technologies of today. It’s easier to hire creative and forward-thinking professionals excited to work with the new technology which increases team productivity and propels innovation.","dir":"/case-studies","path":"/case-studies/better-faster-stronger-how-edmodo-leverages-best-engineering-practices-to-provide-remote-education-for-the-masses","extension":".md","slug":"better-faster-stronger-how-edmodo-leverages-best-engineering-practices-to-provide-remote-education-for-the-masses","createdAt":"2022-04-07T16:02:45.903Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-07T16:02:45.903Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1649347411967},"$loki":3},{"cta_header":"Have any questions about Serverless?","tags":["serverless","aws","vue.js","postgresql","nativescript","mobile"],"related_content":[],"title":"From Monolith to Serverless Microservices: How Tuition.io Disrupts $1.52 Trillion Student Debt Industry with New Technology","short_title":"Tuition.io - Serverless","header_one":"$ Millions","header_two":"of student loan debt served each month with new system","header_three":null,"image_url":"https://images.rightbalance.io/uploads/tuition-logo-white.png","toc":[{"id":"challenge","depth":2,"text":"Challenge"},{"id":"outdated-monilithic-architecture","depth":3,"text":"Outdated Monolithic Architecture"},{"id":"low-visibility","depth":3,"text":"Low Visibility Into The System"},{"id":"no-streamlined-process","depth":3,"text":"No Streamlined Process"},{"id":"solution","depth":2,"text":"Solution"},{"id":"execution","depth":2,"text":"Execution"},{"id":"componentized-front-end","depth":3,"text":"Componentized Front End"},{"id":"serverless-microservices-on-backend","depth":3,"text":"Serverless Microservices on the Backend"},{"id":"cicd","depth":3,"text":"Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery"},{"id":"data-migration","depth":3,"text":"Data Migration"},{"id":"mobile","depth":3,"text":"Mobile"},{"id":"results","depth":2,"text":"Results"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"className":["heading"],"id":"challenge"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Challenge"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Tuition.io brings student loan repayment benefits to the nation’s best companies to free their employees from student debt.

Raised over $2.1B in total funding Fair simplified the car leasing process so anyone can do it all from the app. Fair is one of the great examples of how to use technology to streamline the lengthy process of leasing a car.\n\nAs the company scaled rapidly, with the quickly growing amount of data, it’s important to maintain data integrity. Making business decisions based on real and meaningful data is key in today’s world. That being said, there were several challenges to overcome to maintain proper data integrity.\n\n> Information is the oil of the 21st century, and analytics is the combustion engine.\n> - Peter Sondergaard, Gartner Research\n\n<h3 id=\"intergrity-validation\" class=\"subheading\">Integrity Validation</h3>\n\nAs more microservices were written the data became more fragmented. As the data grew, it became harder to validate data integrity across multiple databases.\n\n<h3 id=\"data-transmission-robustness\" class=\"subheading\">Data Transmission Robustness</h3>\n\nFair migrated from the [monolithic architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application) to [microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) to support the increased scaling needs. New microservices communicate with each other through a messaging channel. While the messaging between microservices works most of the time, in some cases some messages were dropped, failed, or retried multiple times causing some data discrepancies. At scale the discrepancies become noticeable.\n\n<h3 id=\"lack-of-idempotency-controls\" class=\"subheading\">Lack of Idempotency Controls</h3>\n\nWhat used to happen in a single process in a monolith, now happened across multiple microservices.

Once the framework is in place, we can run it at any time, to verify the data, and to discover discrepancies.\n\n<h3 id=\"preventing-discrepancies\" class=\"subheading\">Preventing Discrepancies in the First Place</h3>\n\nNow that the issues are discovered by the validation framework, we can go back and implement the changes to prevent it from happening again. Doing so allows us to fix the issue, establish a higher standard of software development on the team, and adding some additional automated tests running continuously testing the system.\n\n<h3 id=\"unit-tests-rock-solid\" class=\"subheading\">Make Existing Unit Tests Rock Solid</h3>\n\nOne of the qualities of a great unit test suite is producing a reliable result.

In addition to it, they amplify the effectiveness of their main skill with some complementary skills like people management, leadership, product strategy, architecture, and more. Doing so allows them to operate at a higher level of efficiency than a regular engineer making each contribution more impactful.\n\n### Self-Sufficient\n\nA 10x-er is usually self-sufficient, doesn’t need hand-holding, and doesn’t need to be micromanaged. They enjoy the freedom of making their own decisions. Choosing what to work on and how to execute allows them to make a greater impact. People of this caliber always keep the big picture in mind allowing them to identify issues and fix them as they go.

This leads us to the next point.\n\n### Excited For a Challenge, Bored from Routine\n\nDeveloping something new is exciting for them. On the other hand, repetitive tasks drain their energy and make them more disengaged. If you have a 10xer on your team, you’ll need to keep them engaged by throwing more challenges at them and perhaps moving them to the next project once the current project gets into the maintenance phase.\n\n### Lead by Example\n\n10x-ers demonstrate their work often, make presentations and get input from their colleagues. They like putting together a proof of concept to see if it’s a fit for the current project. They often challenge the status quo, bringing some fresh perspective into the mix.\n\n### Always Hands-On\n\nYou rarely see a 10xer as a pure hands-off manager. They are always deeply involved in the process. They code, participate in architecture discussions, engaged with product managers and stakeholders while having fun doing it.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n10x engineers are a special breed of people with a set of complementary skills in addition to their strong core engineering fundamentals. They are self-sufficient self-starters, able to identify inefficiencies and opportunities. They execute on them while being hands-on and leading by example.

We decided to use this design because of several factors:\n\n1. **Resiliency.** Each event has business value, so we wanted to ensure that no events are dropped under heavy traffic. Placing events on a durable SQS queue as they occur allows us to retain them as well as retry delivering them in case of a processing failure.\n2. **Elasticity.** One of the main advantages of serverless technology is the ability to use resources on demand.

Knowing what technical debt is helps you work productively with software engineers. This post explains what technical debt is and how to manage it efficiently.\n\n## What is Technical Debt\n\nTechnical debt is similar to credit card debt. You can spend some extra money now with a credit card. If you won’t pay it back shortly, you’ll be charged interest. If you don’t pay it off for a long time, the amount you owe increases drastically. This decreases your credit score which is hard to recover from.\n\nTaking on technical debt in software product development is very similar to it. In order to accomplish a certain feature faster in the short term, a developer can apply a hack. If the hack is not replaced with a well-made out solution, the code around it decays over time. In addition to it, the software is built on top of other software. We all use libraries and operating systems. Technologies change and the system needs maintenance updates as time goes by, even if there are no new features being developed. If maintenance updates are not addressed, it also increases your technical debt.\n\n![Credit Card Debt](https://images.rightbalance.io/uploads/credit_cards.jpeg)\n\n## Why Taking on More Technical Debt Slows You Down\n\nAs you apply more hacks, your future development gets slower, you have more bugs in the product, and you get closer to the point when you need to start over. I’ve seen several companies in the past abandoning and rewriting their entire application from scratch since they were not able to make meaningful progress anymore.\n\n## How to Manage Technical Debt\n\n### Get on the same page with engineers and stakeholders\n\nIt’s crucially important for everyone on your engineering team and for stakeholders to understand the implications of endlessly taking on technical debt. Set up and maintain high code standards and [high test coverage](/solutions/automated-tests-get-dividends-with-every-test-run \"Automated testing solution\") on your engineering team. Make sure that stakeholders understand the technical debt concept and how it affects the speed and quality of the product. Aligning everyone’s expectations goes a long way.\n\n### Pay it off right after you introduced it\n\nEvery system has technical debt. Sometimes we need to focus on short-term goals. In this case, it's ok to introduce technical debt _if and only if_ you can pay it off right after you introduced it. The companies that ignore this important fact and continue to what seems like “moving quickly” will eventually slow down to a halt.\n\n### Revisit your architecture regularly\n\nWhat worked several months ago will not necessarily work now. Especially in startups where businesses grow and change fast, it’s important to revisit decisions made in the past. Take your time to refactor (or better yet, delete) code that no longer makes sense in order to accomplish the needs of today. Bring it up with your team as a part of your retrospectives and make action items to make sure it gets done.\n\n### Pay off big debt incrementally\n\nWhen dealing with legacy systems, it may be too big of a task for one engineer to refactor it. In this case, make a plan on how you want it to look and change it one piece at a time. It’s important to maintain the vision of what you want this legacy system to be at the end.\n\n### Leave the codebase in a better place than when you started\n\nAll that matters is if everyone makes incremental progress towards making the codebase better. It’s impractical to stop feature development to get rid of all technical debt. Maintaining the right balance between feature delivery and paying off technical debt is key.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEvery system out there has technical debt.

As long as the team is disciplined about paying it off, it's ok. At the end of the day, we all want to ship quality product, and managing technical debt is a part of it.\n\n_Photos are provided by_ [_p_valdivieso_](https://www.flickr.com/photos/p_valdivieso/) _and_ [_smemon_](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smemon)\n\nOriginally posted on [alextamoykin.com](https://alextamoykin.com/5-rules-of-managing-technical-debt-how-to-keep-moving-fast-today-and-tomorrow \"alextamoykin.com backlink\")","dir":"/learn","path":"/learn/5-rules-of-managing-technical-debt.how-to-keep-moving-fast-today-and-tomorrow","extension":".md","slug":"5-rules-of-managing-technical-debt.how-to-keep-moving-fast-today-and-tomorrow","createdAt":"2022-04-07T16:02:45.903Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-07T16:02:45.903Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1649347412061},"$loki":10},{"draft":false,"tags":["management","career","product"],"related_content":[],"title":"Build For Scale, Build to Last: 10 Steps to Build a Long Lasting Product","short_title":"Build For Scale, Build to Last","header_one":"Build For Scale","header_two":"Build to Last","header_three":"","cta_header":"Want to build something impactful?","cta_button":"","cta_href":"","icon":"trending-up","icons":[],"image_url":"","toc":[{"id":"building-things-right-makes-everything-else-easier","depth":2,"text":"Building things right makes everything else easier"},{"id":"1-achieve-company-alignment","depth":2,"text":"1.

While developing a software component, engineers should always be focused on developing it in a way so it can deliver customer value and recover gracefully from an error situation.

If you know the person is the best fit for your product and the team, hire them.\nAt the end of the day, people are your most important asset.\n\n## Why advancing in your career benefits everyone\n\nWhen you grow, you’re able to deliver a better quality product, your company gets better as a result of that.\nIn addition to it, you solve harder challenges, make more money, have more impact at the company, and it’s more fun!\n\n## How to advance your career\n\nIn technology companies (i.e. companies where technology plays a major part in product development) engineering\nmanagement recognizes the value of growing their engineers regardless of them becoming managers or not.\nHere comes a typical engineering ladder:\n\n![Engineering ladder](https://images.rightbalance.io/uploads/engineering_ladder_diagram-2.png)\n\nDifferent companies have different levels and ladders. Underlying principals stay the same.\nThe goal of the ladder is to provide a framework for engineers to grow within the company.\n\nAs you can see, all engineers start from Software Engineer I and make it's way to Staff Software Engineer.\nA Staff Software engineer demonstrates a great level of individual contributions in addition to leading moderate size\nprojects and teams. At this point, the engineer has a choice of focusing on management skills or technical skills.\nIf the engineer decides to take the management track, the engineer becomes an Engineering Manager,\nthen a Director of Engineering, VP of Engineering, and CTO. All management related roles include growing the team,\nhiring, people management, resource planning, and so on.\n\n<a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594484805/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1594484805&linkCode=as2&tag=howtoprogramb-20&linkId=40f71fdebcea2a56f8f674b048a6c765\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=1594484805&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=howtoprogramb-20\" ></a><img src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=howtoprogramb-20&l=am2&o=1&a=1594484805\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />\n\nOne of the basic principles of people management is keeping the team motivated.\nWe highly recommend reading the book called [Drive by Daniel Pink.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594484805/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=howtoprogramb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1594484805&linkId=d1dced0c8f563243a3ff97864a66a382) It's a great book talking about what drives us as human beings. You want to make sure to provide people on your team with autonomy, mastery, and purpose to keep your teammates motivated. It goes over the reasons behind it with some case studies and some suggestions on implementing it at your workplace. Another good read is the all-time classic called [Peopleware](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321934113/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=howtoprogramb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0321934113&linkId=df3daf1e07ef06b56ad51bbbaa32511a).\n\nAlternatively, the engineer has a choice of staying on the technical track to become a Principal Software Engineer\nand then a Senior Principal Software Engineer. In this role, the engineer makes technological and architectural\ncontributions across the entire company and improves engineering performance as a result of that.\n\n<a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134032802/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0134032802&linkCode=as2&tag=howtoprogramb-20&linkId=993a83c211014757e438477ed1087438\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=0134032802&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=howtoprogramb-20\" ></a><img src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=howtoprogramb-20&l=am2&o=1&a=0134032802\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />\n\nIt's important to note that a Principal Software Engineer also has to have some managerial skills since the impact\nof this person's work spans across the entire organization. There are numerous books on the subject.\nour favorite is [The Art of Scalability](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134032802/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=howtoprogramb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0134032802&linkId=46a5776c76ddec05de77943cb1798fba).\nIt starts by describing different functions of the technical organization, how they are all connected together,\nand how it connects with technology. It's interesting to note that even though the technology aspect is quite hard\nto implement, it's connecting technology with business functions of the organization is what gives the best results.\n\nNo matter which way you go, as long as you grow within the company, you'll have more impact, bring more value,\nand you'll get paid more. At the end of the days, it's just a personal preference. If you like coding and you're not\na big fan of people management, you can safely stick to the technical track. If you're passionate about hiring,\nmentoring, and people management then talk to your manager about getting on the management track when the right time comes.\n\n## Finishing thoughts\n\nWe spend so much of our life working on products. You want to make sure you’re happy at your workplace.\nTalk to your manager about your long-term career goals and plans. Everybody wins when you grow. Work hard, have fun\nand the right things will happen.\n\nOriginally posted on [alextamoykin.com](https://alextamoykin.com/do-you-have-to-become-a-manager-to-advance-as-a-software-engineer)","dir":"/learn","path":"/learn/do-you-have-to-become-a-manager-to-advance-as-a-software-engineer","extension":".md","slug":"do-you-have-to-become-a-manager-to-advance-as-a-software-engineer","createdAt":"2022-04-07T16:02:45.903Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-07T16:02:45.903Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1649347412119},"$loki":13},{"draft":false,"tags":["qa","management"],"related_content":[],"title":"How to Reduce Manual QA, Increase Product Quality, and Iterate Faster","short_title":"Automate manual QA","header_one":"Reduce manual QA","header_two":"While Increasing Product Quality","header_three":"","cta_header":"Need a hand automating manual tests?","cta_button":"","cta_href":"","icon":"car-shift-pattern","icons":[],"image_url":"","toc":[{"id":"why-reducing-manual-qa","depth":2,"text":"Why reducing manual QA"},{"id":"manual-qa-doesnt-scale-well","depth":3,"text":"Manual QA doesn’t scale well"},{"id":"what-are-automated-tests","depth":2,"text":"What are automated tests"},{"id":"how-to-automate-your-tests","depth":2,"text":"How to automate your tests"},{"id":"product-managers-to-provide-clear-requirements","depth":3,"text":"Product Managers to provide clear requirements"},{"id":"engineers-write-unit-and-integration-tests","depth":3,"text":"Engineers write unit and integration tests"},{"id":"dont-automate-every-single-thing","depth":3,"text":"Don’t automate every single thing"},{"id":"qa-engineers-test-interactions-between-systems","depth":3,"text":"QA engineers test interactions between systems"},{"id":"conclusion","depth":2,"text":"Conclusion"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Product development is a very complex task involving ideation, product and project management, design, software engineering, and testing.

In addition to it, there are only so many manual tests that a human can execute per day.\n\n### **Manual QA doesn’t scale well**\n\nAs mentioned previously, what happens after you develop more features, a number of manual tests increases and teams usually make one of the following decisions. They either hire more QA staff or execute fewer tests. Unfortunately, most of the companies I’ve seen go with the second approach which causes bugs, loss of customers, and lost revenue.\n\nThere is another way, have computers execute tests for you.\n\n## What are automated tests\n\nWhen you write a piece of software, you want to make sure it works correctly. Let’s say, you implemented a login screen in your mobile app. After you’re done with your task, you may go ahead, stand up the app and try logging into the system. After you move on to the next feature, you test the next feature in a similar way. As you develop more features, you can’t possibly test all features you developed to date.

In addition to it, it’s tough to identify the best testing strategy if you don’t know what kind of product you’re building. Make sure your product manager provides clear acceptance criteria for every user story.\n\n### Engineers write unit and integration tests\n\nThe problem with a manual test is that you need to have a human executing it every single time which is expensive. If you automate your test, you spend a little more effort upfront by writing it. Then, you have your [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) servers running tests for you as many times and as often as you would like.\n\n### Don’t automate every single thing\n\nIt’s a delicate balance between what makes sense to automate and what doesn’t. You have to compare time cost vs benefit. In some cases, an integration test gives you the most bang for the buck. In some cases, it’s easier to test an isolated piece of logic with a unit test instead.\n\n### QA engineers test interactions between systems\n\nIf your product consists of multiple systems (like a mobile front end, a web front end, multiple back-end services, etc), it’s important to test all pieces working together. Software engineers make sure every system is functioning correctly. However, it doesn’t really matter if each piece works as expected if the system as a whole doesn’t work. Cross-functional tests are the toughest to write. Make sure you automate the tests you execute most often manually first to be more efficient.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAutomated tests are a great way to increase quality and iterate faster. If you keep your tests healthy, you can ship your software to production at any time. It allows you to move quicker, iterate and learn faster. Writing automated tests is an important skill for every software engineer. It takes some time to develop and it pays off big time. Every system is different.

You're done with the ideation, you made some mockups and it's time to start building it. The only issue is that there is no one to work it on since all engineers are already allocated for their current projects. New full-time hires and interviews take time. New opportunities are passing by or even worse, implemented by your competitors.\n\nThis blog post has several ways to start on a new project despite the limiting factors allowing you to achieve the next step in your business and in your professional career.\n\n## How to bring new engineering resources quickly\n\nThere are several ways to add new resources to your team. Each way is different and has to be done right. Here they are:\n\n### Build vs Buy\n\nIf there is already a reliable solution for your current problem out there, it's a great option to consider. There is no need to reinvent the wheel. While developing a custom solution will fit your exact needs, software development is an involved and complicated process. What seems super simple on the outside is usually just the tip of the iceberg. There are more things to think about like solution reliability, cost, integration timeline, etc. Researching existing services or products that do parts or the whole solution is worthwhile doing before making a [Build vs Buy decision](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckcohn/2014/09/15/build-vs-buy-how-to-know-when-you-should-build-custom-software-over-canned-solutions/#5bd14fec371e).\n\n### Outsource\n\nBecause growing your business is hard work, it's important to choose your battles. Focusing on your core competencies and outsourcing everything else will help to accelerate your business growth. For example, if your core business is centered around Data Analysis, you may want to hire a reputable firm to create a beautiful Front End plugged into your Data Analysis API. This option allows you to avoid wasting precious time on building a new Front End practice in-house and to double down on what you do best. While completely outsourcing the non-core parts of your product saves you time, you want to make sure you still own what you outsourced. Make sure you have some technical documentation of the solution as well as the source code and the instructions on how to get it up and running (which is a standard procedure at [Right Balance](/)).\n\n### Staff Augmentation\n\nIf you would like to have more horsepower to start a new project immediately, and it's within the area of your core competency, then [staff augmentation](/learn/staff-augmentation-how-to-get-some-extra-help-when-you-need-it \"Staff Augmentation\") is your best option. The new team members plug into your existing team and work together in lockstep allowing for some rapid innovation and quick feature iteration. Staff Augmentation allows you to keep the momentum going every day, solve blockers promptly, and deliver things on time. It also allows you to learn from external team members about the new ways of building the [best product](/learn/build-for-scale-build-to-last-10-steps-to-build-a-long-lasting-product  \"10 steps to build the best product\"). New team members can bring a fresh perspective to the company.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEven though there is a set number of engineers available at your company, there are proven ways to start a new project at any time.

In some industries like factory manufacturing, it’s the only option. That said, with the current state of technology and especially for thought workers like software engineers, it’s no longer a requirement. With a high-performance laptop and an Internet connection, you can work from anywhere in the world, including your home office. Remote workforce unlocks limitless possibilities for your business like getting access to a larger and more cost-efficient pool of talent internationally. Especially in the pandemic, when going into an office is complicated, there is no reason for not taking the advantage of global remote work opportunities.\n\n## Why Remote is Great\n\n### Big Companies Go Remote\n\nLarge companies like [Github](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/teams/collaborating-at-github-with-a-60--remote-workforce) (bought by Microsoft), [InVision](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-InVision-EI_IE912781.11,19.htm), [37signals](https://37signals.com/) (makers of [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) and creators of [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)) were already operating remotely even before the pandemic. There are books written on a subject like [Remote](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804137501/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0804137501&linkCode=as2&tag=howtoprogramb-20&linkId=7975a9b05dc299f15f7e104f0228bebc).\n\n<a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804137501/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0804137501&linkCode=as2&tag=howtoprogramb-20&linkId=611578c3e043dbf86bd8a76ef379fdab\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=0804137501&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=howtoprogramb-20\" ></a><img src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=howtoprogramb-20&l=am2&o=1&a=0804137501\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />\n\n### Remote is here to stay\n\nEspecially in the pandemic, remote work is the new norm. Per [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/tech-companies-are-looking-at-more-flexible-work-models-when-offices-reopen/): even when the offices reopen, companies are looking at flexible work models.\n\n### Larger pool of more cost-effective talent\n\nThe remote workforce unlocks the possibility of hiring people outside of your city and even your country. You can have a truly international team of professionals working in lockstep with you.\n\nNeedless to say, due to the cost of living difference between the United States and the rest of the world, you’ll get some amazingly skilled and motivated professionals at the fraction of the cost of a local US employee. No need to worry about immigration either. Remote workers can be hired as individual contractors through a contracting company reducing the complexity of your payroll.\n\nWith remote, you’re tapping into a larger pool of talent than in your local city. It’s especially helpful if you’re looking to fulfill multiple roles at your company and the local job market is very competitive.\n\nWorth noting that in some countries, higher education is more accessible and less costly than in the US. So yes, you can hire a remote worker who actually knows how software algorithms and data structures work ;-)\n\n### More Productivity and Focus\n\nWorking at the office, especially with an open floor plan, can be distracting. It’s very easy to spend your entire day between meetings, random conversations with your peers, especially with the hard work requiring a high amount of mental energy and concentration like software engineering.\n\nWorking remotely solves this problem. With a properly set up personal office, there are fewer distractions, leaving more time for individual contributions. A book on a subject is my all-time favorite: [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455586692/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1455586692&linkCode=as2&tag=howtoprogramb-20&linkId=46b086be5569689988b467402a54c7ce): Rules for Focused Success In a Distracted World.\n\n<a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455586692/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1455586692&linkCode=as2&tag=howtoprogramb-20&linkId=06538a88eefeffef43601d0cf77295db\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=1455586692&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=howtoprogramb-20\" ></a><img src=\"//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=howtoprogramb-20&l=am2&o=1&a=1455586692\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />\n\n## How To Work With a Remote Team\n\n### Timezone\n\nThe key to managing distributed teams is maintaining the concept of Core Hours. Core hours is when everyone, regardless of the local time zone are available for cross-team communication and meetings. For example, if you’re in the US and you have people in multiple geographic regions like Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Asia, then all of them should be available during your core hours, usually between your morning and noon. People located in the timezone with more proximity (for example US and Latin America) will have more overlap with your team.\n\n### Video Calls\n\nRegular meetings like standups, sprint plannings, retrospectives, debugging sessions can happen over video calls. The most popular options are [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), [GoToMeeting](https://www.gotomeeting.com/), [Google Meet](https://gsuite.google.com/products/meet/). Most of the video conferencing software allows you to add multiple attendees, share your camera and your screen. It’s especially useful if you would like to walk your team through a presentation. If you have an issue you need some help with, you can have a video call with your remote co-worker to troubleshoot it over a screen sharing session.\n\n### Messaging / Chat\n\nWith the evolution of messaging software, it’s now more efficient to communicate over messaging than talking to a large group. The advantages of using messaging for your communication are that it’s searchable, can be referred to later on, and it works for communicating with your entire team regardless of the physical location of your team members. Most notable options are [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software), [HipChat](https://www.atlassian.com/software/hipchat/downloads).\n\n### Tracking Progress\n\nYou most likely already use these tools to track your projects. [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Asana](http://asana.com), [Monday](https://monday.com/) or a good old school spreadsheet (yes, people still do it, and it works great!) are available to track your team’s progress. Remote team members are assigned some tickets to work on. Once the work is started, the ticket is moved to in progress, then in QA, and to done. All steps along the way you’ll know exactly who works on what and when the work is ready to be reviewed.\n\n### Pushing Code\n\nChances are that you’re already using these tools too. There is no need to host a private git repository on your secret server in a closet. Services like [Github](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) are available for your team. You can set the individual permissions for each code repository and assign different permissions to your engineers as you see fit. All code gets pushed to the same repository. Remote workers will follow your standard code review procedure using the same code standards that you already have.\n\n### Testing\n\nStopping by at your developer’s desk to see the progress is inefficient and distractive. So you should be already using services like [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/app-distribution) to distribute your test builds for your mobile app. The websites are deployed to your QA or staging environment for testing which you can access from your web browser. You can check the database with your database client like [Sequel Pro](https://www.sequelpro.com/) or [Navicat](https://www.navicat.com/). Your API can be tested with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). And your cloud is easy to manage using [Commandeer](https://getcommandeer.com/).\n\n### Security\n\nSecurity is the top priority for remote workers. At [Right Balance](https://rightbalance.io/), we follow the best security practices like using [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network), [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) keys, hard disk encryption, being able to erase a laptop remotely, and more.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith the current state of technology, remote workers enable your business to achieve greater heights. And as you can see, it’s not that different from your current way of working anyway. There is no reason for not taking advantage of a larger pool of high-quality talent in timezone-friendly regions like Latin America and Eastern Europe. In addition to it, due to a lower cost of living, remote workers are more cost-efficient, as well as more motivated to work with an international team.\n\nOriginally posted at [alextamoykin.com](https://alextamoykin.com/unlock-the-power-of-remote-workforce-for-your-business)\n","dir":"/learn","path":"/learn/unlock-the-power-of-the-global-remote-workforce-for-your-business","extension":".md","slug":"unlock-the-power-of-the-global-remote-workforce-for-your-business","createdAt":"2022-04-07T16:02:45.903Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-07T16:02:45.903Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1649347412158},"$loki":17},{"tags":["hiring","management"],"related_content":[],"title":"Why Hiring Senior Engineers is Hard And How to Solve It","short_title":"Why hiring engineers is hard","header_two":"Why Hiring Senior Engineers","header_three":"is Hard","icon":"star","cta_header":"Need help hiring senior engineers?","toc":[{"id":"overview","depth":2,"text":"Overview"},{"id":"why-hiring-is-hard","depth":2,"text":"Why Hiring Is Hard"},{"id":"how-to-solve-engineering-deficit","depth":2,"text":"How To Solve Engineering Deficit"},{"id":"growing-existing-talent","depth":3,"text":"Growing Existing Talent"},{"id":"hiring-junior-engineers-or-interns","depth":3,"text":"Hiring Junior Engineers or Interns"},{"id":"contractors","depth":3,"text":"Contractors"},{"id":"contract-to-hire","depth":3,"text":"Contract to hire"},{"id":"final-thoughts","depth":2,"text":"Final Thoughts"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"overview"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#overview","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Overview"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"If you're in an engineering leadership position like Engineering Manager, Director, VP, CTO, one of your main responsibilities is to grow your engineering team.

Senior Software Engineers are a precious resource for your company.\nThat being said, the minute you have several positions open, you realize that hiring is an involved, slow, and expensive process.\nThis post has several solutions to increase your headcount.\n\n## Why Hiring Is Hard\nHiring a full-time employee is very hard. Especially in the technology field. The reason behind it is that there are\nmany more jobs than quality candidates available in the industry. Despite the companies offering jobs, the reality is\nwe’re at the mercy of the decision of a great candidate due to the law of supply and demand. Scarcity gets higher,\nthe higher you aim for the level of your hires. Great senior engineers are either not looking for a new job or have\nmultiple job offers quickly when they start looking. This in turn leads to higher competition between companies.\nThe company offering the best perks, the highest salary, and the most interesting projects to work on wins the best\ncandidates. In addition to it, there are companies like Google and Amazon who just pay more than anybody else which is\nhard to compete against.\n\n## How To Solve Engineering Deficit\nThere are several solutions to this problem. Each has its pros and cons. Let's go over it.\n\n### Growing Existing Talent\nA great full-time employee is a company asset. With some effective management, you should always see some opportunities\nfor leveling up your full-time employees. During your one on ones, ask some questions about what goals your engineers\nwant to achieve. Everyone has some opportunities for improvement. Going to conferences, learning new technologies,\ngiving a technical talk at a local meetup, or improving leadership skills are just some examples. Keeping your\nemployees engaged and growing them professionally will go a long way. On another hand, growing employees takes time.\nThere is also a risk of your employees leaving your company taking the fruits of your labor with them.\n\n### Hiring Junior Engineers or Interns\nJunior engineers can offer a fresh perspective to an existing team of seasoned engineers. With the right mix of senior\nand junior engineers, it creates great team dynamics. Senior engineers are excited to share their knowledge and the\njunior engineers can keep the senior engineers accountable for producing a lot of business value despite their senior level.\nNeedless to say, there are a lot more Junior engineers available on the job market than seniors. On the downside,\ngrowing junior engineers also takes time. In addition to it, you can only take it so far, hiring too many juniors hurts\nyour team. Once your team becomes Junior heavy you start spinning the wheels where your senior staff spends most of the\ntime handholding, unblocking, and mentoring juniors instead of improving your system architecture and processes.\n\n### Contractors\nContractors come to your team already equipped with the latest software, hardware, and the knowledge of building similar\nproducts in the industry. Due to working on multiple projects in the past, contractors can identify and address some\npotential scalability concerns before they become real issues. A reputable contracting firm comes with a pool of\nengineers allowing them to take on larger projects than individual contractors. In addition to it, a firm has\nspecialists with complementary skills like designers, product managers, QA engineers, etc, which helps them to execute\nquickly and efficiently on a broad range of tasks. On the downside, contractors are not your full-time employees,\nand you need to make sure they work with you the way you prefer. If you would like to enhance your existing team with\nsome additional resources, then [Staff Augmentation](/learn/staff-augmentation-how-to-get-some-extra-help-when-you-need-it)\nis a great option. This way your team enhanced with some contractors moving in lockstep.\nIf you prefer more of a hands-off approach where you give your contractors a project\nand the work is performed outside of your development cycle, you want to make sure you still own the end product.\nIt's easy to hand off a project and discover that what was built is not something you wanted.\n\n### Contract to hire\nIf you would like to convert a contractor into a full-time employee, a contract to hire arrangement is for you.\nSuch an arrangement come in different shape and form. If you're looking for a full-time employee and you would like to\nget a feel of how it is to work together with a candidate, you can hire a candidate for several months with an option\nto transition to an FTE. Converting an existing contractor to an FTE is also a possibility. That being said, you want\nto make sure that the contractor or the firm the contractor represents is onboard with such transition and of course,\nthe contractor wants to do it too.\n\n## Final Thoughts\nAs you can see, there are many ways to hire new talent starting from hiring FTEs, growing the existing talent to hiring\ncontractors. All of which are just different tools allowing you to attract and retain the [best talent](/learn/how-to-hire-best-people).\nFinding the right engineering takes time. In addition to filling the potions available,\nyou should also grow your professional network long term. Also, having a reliable contracting firm as your partner goes\na long way.

A properly implemented backend API allows you to drink your IPA while your entire system works for you.\n\n## API Anatomy\n\nHere is what a typical API looks like:\n\n### API Gateway\n\nWhen a client request comes from a web browser, mobile app, or a third party, the first place it goes to is an API Gateway. The goal of API Gateway is to route the request to a specific destination, which is a microservice most of the time. Depending on the API Gateway implementation, it can also handle user authentication and some request transformation before handing it off to the microservice. Last but not least, API Gateway handles the first level of security by routing a request coming from the public Internet to a private resource. Important to note that all resources behind the API Gateway like your microservices and database should remain private and not being exposed to the Internet. Only API Gateway should have the ability to route the right request from the public to the private territory.\n\n### Service Layer\n\nThat’s where the magic happens. Most of your business logic is contained at this level. If you have microservices architecture, different requests will go to different microservices. Depending on your use-case, your service can do any number of things like making a database query, calling another microservice or a 3rd party API, caching some data for future use, writing into a queue, or performing some computation.\n\n## How to Build APIs Right\n\n### Architecture\n\nA properly architected system is at the core of a robust and scalable API. If your API is architected well, everything else comes together naturally. Your product will be able to support your level of traffic and you’ll have a lot of happy customers.\n\nWhen designing your API, you’ll need to minimize the following:\n\n1. A number of single points of failure (which is a database in most cases).\n2. A number of internal calls between services.\n3. Timing of each individual call.\n\nThe main thing to realize is that each call results in a chain of events. While the work is happening the user is waiting for a response. Time and time again we’ve seen a seemingly quick API call taking a long time or sometimes taking the system down. Everyone on the team needs to have a clear idea of which calls are made for each operation and which resources are used during each call. There are a lot of tools out there like [NewRelic](https://newrelic.com/ \"NewRelic website\") or [DataDog](https://www.datadoghq.com/ \"DataDog page\") that help you measure the timing of each individual call between services. You’ll be able to fix the issues before the software gets pushed to prod by instrumenting your app and running some [load tests](/solutions/automated-tests-get-dividends-with-every-test-run#load-tests) against it in your testing environment.\n\n### Scalability\n\nOnce the system is architected for scale, supporting more traffic or less traffic should be as simple as a configuration change. Here are the main things to consider:\n\n#### Scaling Automatically\n\nMost of the cloud providers have auto-scaling capabilities based on certain rules you can specify. In addition to it, we recommend looking into [Serverless tech](/solutions/serverless-software-development-focus-on-features-instead-of-the-infrastructure) allowing for scaling automatically with the increase or decrease in traffic. If your server provisioning is manual at the moment, it’s worth thinking about automating it. This way you can spend your engineering resources on developing new features or improving the strength of the overall system instead of manually provisioning servers.\n\n#### Minimize Service Chaining\n\nEspecially with microservices, it’s easy to fall into a trap of ‘nano services’. Making your services too granular can lead to an increase in the number of inner service calls. It’s a good idea to avoid making one service call another service and so on and so forth. The longer the call chain, the greater the possibility of a failure at each step, and the overall call length increases too. In addition to it, debugging a call spanning across multiple services is much harder than debugging a single call to a single service.\n\n#### Alerting and Monitoring\n\nAlerting and monitoring is your best friend. It should be a part of the requirement for every feature. When your alerting and monitoring are properly set up you sleep better at night. It allows you to be more proactive about fixing the issues before they become problems. If something goes wrong, you’ll get notified and you’ll stay ahead of the game. This also increases the accountability of your team. The systems need to be developed so they always work without human intervention.\n\nA great book on a subject is [Art of Scalability](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134032802/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=howtoprogramb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0134032802&linkId=55bea73bd8158a7441b84e4d4921bbb3 \"The art of scalability book\").\n\n### Cost Efficiency\n\nYour backend API is what makes your system scale to support a large number of users. With the increase in traffic comes the increase in cost. Therefore, when building your backend, you should be aware of the cost implications of your implementation decisions. We recommend focusing on the following areas:\n\n#### Keeping your operational database slim\n\nThe main purpose of your operational database is to serve the immediate API requests. Anything else adds to the database size, decreases the database availability, and makes scaling the database harder, especially for SQL databases.\n\n#### Keeping your non-production environments small\n\nDepending on your use-case, you’ll need a number of different environments. For a simple scenario having just 3 environments works just fine (development, staging, and production). As your organization grows, you’ll have more use cases you need to support and the number of environments will grow too. The key here is to have all production and pre-production environments with the same configuration. And all the rest of the systems with a scaled-down version of your resources to keep the cost down. In addition to it, using Serverless or Containers helps to minimize idle server time.\n\n#### Using the right tool for the job\n\nWe’ve seen many cases where a SQL database stores all application logs, acts as a search index for different kinds of queries, and even acts as a data warehouse while providing data for the API requests. There are solutions made specifically for each type of problem to solve. Logs can be archived into some flat files and processed offline. There are plenty of search solutions like [Elastic Search](https://www.elastic.co/ \"Elastic Search page\") or [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/ \"Algolia Website\"). A data warehouse needs to be separate from your runtime operational database so your data analyst doesn’t bring your runtime system down. Plus data warehouse users need the data in a different format. When using the right solution for each type of problem, you’ll be able to provide a better experience for the users. You’ll also have better control over your system cost.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYour backend infrastructure is the heart of your system. It supports your client applications at scale. Architecting your backend system right makes everything else easier. Using the right tool for the job is key. There are specialized solutions for each type of problem. The goal is to build it so it always works with some comprehensive alerting and monitoring in place notifying you about the issues in advance.

That being said, once your team grows in size, engineers write more code, manually testing each new and existing feature is not effective anymore. Bugs get into production making customers unhappy. This is where automated testing comes in. Automated tests are a codified version of manual tests. The tests are written by engineers. Once they’re written they can run over and over again while your engineers are working on the text feature.\n\n## Advantages of Automated Testing\n\n### Write Robust and Modular Code\n\nThis is perhaps one of the most important advantages of automated testing. What makes testing easier is structuring your code in a modular way. Modularizing your architecture allows you to swap out or refactor each module in isolation without affecting the rest of the system.\n\nIn addition to your code being modular, your code will also be more robust. When running your tests with some randomized data or by using [mutation testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing \"Mutation Testing Overview\"), your code gets executed under different conditions. Seeing the code you wrote fail under some conditions you didn’t think about is eye-opening. It allows you to account for more edge cases and make your code more robust.\n\n### Refactor\n\nYour product changes, your customer change, and your code need to change as a result of it. Refactoring makes changing your code easier. Automated tests allow you to make sure your code works as expected once the refactor is complete. This way you can refactor without any fear of breaking your already working system.\n\n### Minimize Bugs\n\nAutomated tests catch bugs. With the constantly growing amount of code, we humans are not able to keep all code paths in our heads which leads to unexpected bugs. Automated tests help exercise all code paths involved so you can focus on the task at hand as opposed to constantly retesting the entire system and hypothesizing where it can break.\n\n### Tests are Your Documentation\n\nTests document the existing behavior of your system. When structured correctly, and especially with the use of [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development#:\\~:text=In%20software%20engineering%2C%20behavior%2Ddriven,participants%20in%20a%20software%20project. \"Behavior Driven Development\") syntax, your tests are your system documentation. You can use it to ramp up new engineers as well as a reference for how your system works in practice.\n\n### Tests Prove That Your System Works\n\nThe code you write may be the greatest code ever and you may think it works. That being said, you never know if it actually works until it’s in production serving real customers. A green test suite is proof of your code working as expected as opposed to a guess or a good feeling that your system will work.\n\n### Get Dividends With Each Test Run\n\nWriting automated tests is an investment that pays dividends with every test run. Once the test is written, there is no need to execute it again manually. You can run an automated test at any time on-demand, or have it running automatically on every new code change. Every time you run it, it makes sure your system behaves the way it should.\n\n## Disadvantages of Automated Testing\n\nThe main disadvantage of automated testing is that it makes a large sweeping change harder. If you’re writing a prototype, or your product didn’t achieve the product-market fit, then automated tests will get in the way of pivoting or making a full restructure change. Ironically, this is one of the most common reasons for not adopting automated testing. The teams we’ve seen tried to do it too early. After having some bad experience with it, they stopped testing altogether and never came back to it. Only discovering later that they wrote a lot of tightly coupled code that is hard to test.\n\n## Efficient Testing Strategy\n\nOur recommendation is to double down on unit tests, write fewer integration tests, and fewer UI/API tests. Why? Because unit tests are the easiest to write, fastest to run, easiest to parallelize, and it forces you to produce a robust baseline for your modular architecture. Integration and unit tests have some great coverage. On another hand it’s hard to write integration tests, they are slower and more brittle. Let’s go over each kind of test in detail.\n\n## Anatomy of Automated Testing\n\n### Unit Tests\n\nUnit tests test a specific unit of code. They’re usually isolated testing a specific class, a specific function, or a small group of classes and functions. Unit Tests are usually written by the engineers while the functionality is implemented. Most of the business logic is covered by unit tests. Since the unit of code under each test is relatively small, you can set up different conditions for each test. It works especially well when setting up each test with some randomized data. Unit tests are quickest to run, they are the easiest to parallelize and optimize. We recommend writing most of your test cases at the unit test level.\n\n### Integration Tests\n\nWhile unit tests test each unit of code in isolation, an integration test tests how multiple units work together. Due to a higher level of complexity, these tests are usually slower to run, harder to set up, and harder to parallelize. It’s also harder to test boundary conditions because the test set up is more complicated. That’s why we recommend writing fewer cases and structuring your integration tests to cover a larger number of integration points in each test.\n\n### UI / API Tests\n\nUI Tests drive your GUI (i.e. click or tap actual buttons on the screen, etc) and API tests drive your API (i.e. sending real HTTP or GraphQL requests to your endpoints, etc). As you probably guessed UI or API tests are one of the slowest to run and the most complicated to set up. The reason is that they operate at the UI or API level which is usually just the tip of the iceberg. That being said, UI or API tests give you the most coverage for the number of tests. Here, we recommend going with a few happy paths to make sure everything behaves as needed, all screens render properly and all requests come back as normal.\n\n### Test Suite\n\nSince you get the main benefit of automated tests when you execute it, your test suite is your best friend. The test suite runs all necessary tests in sequence parallelizing tests where it’s possible. Depending on your situation you may have several test suites running at different stages of the process. We recommend creating a robust [CI/CD pipeline](/solutions/ci-cd-like-ac-dc-rock-n-roll-with-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery) which runs before merging your feature branches and when you deploy your code.\n\n### Load Tests\n\nAs the name suggests, load tests test your system under load. There are numerous tools available starting from a simple CLI tool like [Apache Benchmark](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html \"Apache Benchmark Overview\") to more sophisticated solutions with a GUI like [jMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/ \"jMeter\") or [Locust](https://locust.io/ \"Locust\"). We recommend performing load testing in a separate environment similar in capacity to a production environment. This way we compare apples to apples. Before running the tests, make sure your monitoring is set up so you can see the metrics before, during, and after the test. Depending on your system, you might want to monitor your database throughput, CPU / Memory / Hard Disk usage of your application servers, etc.\n\n## How To Start With Automated Testing\n\nAll it takes is just starting to do it. If you don’t have a test suite running, getting it to run and putting it on CI is the first step. There are several ways to give the team visibility into the health of your automated tests. You can enable CI notifications about the failed builds to go to Slack. Another helpful technique is exposing the CI status as a dashboard on a TV in the office. Once you have your tests running seeing your test data will become eye-opening. Even if your test suite has just a few tests.\n\nIf you’re dealing with a monolithic tightly coupled system, the main thing is to start carving out some pieces of the monolith into smaller chunks which are easier to test in isolation. Step by step you’ll be able to take your system under control.\n\n## Advanced Topics\n\n* [Dependency Injection and Mocking](https://www.objc.io/issues/15-testing/dependency-injection/ \"Objc.io issue on dependency injection and mocking\")\n* [Data Randomization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_testing \"Data randomization in testing\")\n* [Mutation Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing \"Mutation testing\")\n\n## Book References\n\n* [Working With Legacy Code](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131177052/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=howtoprogramb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0131177052&linkId=987b7883189add3eef3cd3b2c3f31b1d \"Working with legacy code book\")\n* [Refactoring](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134757599/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=howtoprogramb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0134757599&linkId=5afcd14ce8949fc392799e8d92ca6535 \"Refactoring book\")\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAutomated testing is a great way to make sure you write modular and robust code that always works.

It’s a process of delivering your code continuously using an automated pipeline as opposed to doing a manual one [big bang](https://svpg.com/big-bang-releases/ \"Big bang deployment overview\") waterfall deployment.\n\n### Continuous Integration\n\nMost of the software teams use a source control system like Git. We’ve several different branching strategies like [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ \"Git flow branching strategy\"). All of the strategies have one thing in common. There is a single mainline development branch. Each developer creates his/her own branch of the mainline and works independently on a feature. Once the feature is ready, the code is reviewed and merged back to the mainline.\n\n### Continuous Delivery\n\nNow that the code is merged into the mainline, we need to go through the rest of the steps like deploying it, doing QA, and eventually, pushing the new code to production to serve some real users. Each step involves some build process that has to happen to build, test, and deliver the code to the right place. This is where an automated pipeline comes into play where each step is automated following some established conventions everyone on the team follows.\n\n## Advantages of using CI/CD\n\n### Speed\n\nThe main advantage of CI/CD is the increase in velocity. Once you have the process and the pipeline in place, you’ll be able to ship your changes faster. As with any process, it’s just more efficient to do the same steps over and over again rather than shipping changes ad-hoc differently each time. It removes the need for extra communication between the team members and between different teams. Everyone follows the same process. Developers know where to merge to code. QA team knows where to get a new build to test. It’s clear how to deploy to each environment including production and how to troubleshoot some issues.\n\n### Quality\n\nCI/CD brings some automation allowing you to take advantage of automated tests, having your compiler catch bugs, and your automated deployments exercising your infrastructure. With all the automation in place, you start investing in the health of your system, getting some dividends with each test added instead of playing catchup using some manual testing. Every run of your pipeline runs hundreds (and sometimes even more) of automated tests to make sure your product is rock solid when it comes to production.\n\n### Consistency\n\nAs we all know, humans are inconsistent, and computers are great at doing the same thing over and over again. No human will be able to build, test, and deploy your changes multiple times a day consistently. Automated pipelines, when done right, always work for you. Consistency makes your compliance process easier to maintain. And while the CI server is running your pipeline, you have your developers writing some new features. Which is more fun than building and deploying anyway 😉.\n\n## Anatomy of a CI/CD Pipeline\n\nMost of the automated pipelines consist of the following major steps:\n\n![A typical CI/CD pipeline](https://images.rightbalance.io/uploads/cicd-pipeline.svg)\n\n### Build\n\nWhile developers make their changes, we want to make sure the code builds into a runnable product. Here, we run a compiler and/or linter for scripting based languages to make sure we’re able to run the code.\n\n### Test\n\nThe next step is to test your code. We run our automated tests to make sure the code we built does what we expect it to do. At this step, we’ll catch any bugs that happen along the way so the developer can fix them early in the process before they go out to the real world.\n\n### Deploy\n\nNow the code is built and tested, let’s go ahead and deploy it to a real environment. We’ll package the code for deployment including the necessary libraries and the configuration. Once it’s ready for us to push, we deploy it directly to the cloud provider using their API.\n\n### Verify\n\nOnce the code is deployed, we’ll run some comprehensive, non-destructive tests against a deployed environment to make sure the code runs in the cloud the way we expect it to run.\n\n### Notify\n\nOnce the pipeline is finished running, we notify the developer of the successful deployment. Most of the notifications go to slack or email. Important to note that if failures happen along the way, the pipeline notifies the developer of the failed step so the action can be taken promptly.\n\n## How You Can Implement CI/CD\n\n### Lock in Your Branching Strategy\n\nWe recommend following [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ \"Git Flow Overview\") or some variation of it. Making sure everyone follows the same process for branching makes everything easier. If you have multiple environments (like development, staging, and production) you may want to name your branches the same way so it’s easy to map the branches to the environments the code should be deployed to.\n\n### Build, Test, Deploy\n\nChances are, you either already have a way to build, test, and deploy your code. The goal here is to distill it down to a single command you can run from your terminal. If your build process involves running multiple commands, no problem, we’ll just write a build script running each step. If you don’t have automated tests, the best first step is to set up a testing framework and add it to the CI pipeline. Once tests run automatically, it’s easy to add them one by one gradually. Last but not least, your deployment has to happen using a single command. What we’ve seen in the past is that a lot of software teams end up with a large spreadsheet of steps to run for each release. Worry not, each of those massive spreadsheets can be distilled down to a single command step by step.\n\n### Pipeline it\n\nNow you have all your steps in order, it’s easy to put it together into a pipeline. There are numerous technology choices starting from self-hosted options like [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/ \"Jenkins Website\") all the way to some hosted solutions like [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/ \"CircleCI website\") and [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/ \"Azure Pipelines - CI/CD from Azure\"). It all depends on your system and your current technology stack. At this point, it comes down to either creating an account for a hosted CI provider or standing up Jenkins inside your infrastructure and wiring the steps together with some configuration files using YAML or similar configuration language. Yes, we want our infrastructure to [run as code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code \"IAC overview\") so we can stand it up at any time.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCI/CD is key to increasing velocity, developer productivity, and it’s just more fun to focus on features. Which in turn drives the business forward. If you’re in a manual world without the pipeline or perhaps even without the automated tests in place, starting on CI/CD route might seem like an overwhelming task. Worry not, with the right processes in place and some persistence, you’ll get to a place where all you do is push some new code and let the pipeline do the rest of the magic.\n\nIf you would like to get some help with implementing CI/CD into your organization, don’t hesitate to reach out.

This layer performs the actual network requests, parses the data coming from the API. Last but not least, it saves the parsed data into the Data Store Layer in the shape the application expects it.\n\n### Data Store\n\nThe datastore layer is responsible for storing and persisting the data on the client (either in memory or on disk). UI layer gets its data from the store as it changes. The networking layer updates the data in the store as it comes from the API. This way both the UI layer and the networking layer are abstracted and decoupled from each other and can be developed independently.\n\n[CoreData](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/index.html \"CoreData framework\") on iOS, [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/ \"Vuex - a reactive store for Vue.js\") for Vue.js, [Redux](https://redux.js.org/ \"Store for React\") for React, are all examples of a data store for your client-side application.\n\n## Focus areas\n\nBecause your client-side applications’ main function is to interact directly with the user, the primary focus is on the following areas.\n\n### Look and Feel\n\nYour users will be using your UI every single time they interact with your product. That’s why it’s important to have a beautiful, aesthetically pleasing design for your app. When you hold the phone with your application in your hands, or when you have it on the screen of your desktop computer, you should wow over how great the look and feel is. The elements should be clearly positioned on the screen, the user should be able to navigate to each part of the app effortlessly. Adding subtle animations to some UI elements where needed makes the application UI really pop.\n\n### Performance\n\nYour client-side application runs on a device with some limited resources. That’s why the performance is so important because you don’t have the infinitely scalable capacity like you have on the backend. The key here is to offload all heavy work from the main thread to the background thread. Being mindful of your memory usage and your disk usage goes a long way.\n\n### Resiliency\n\nYour backend server is always plugged into the outlet and has access to the Internet. Unfortunately, it’s not the case with client-side devices. Your user's phone or a laptop can lose Internet connectivity at any time, run out of a battery, or even run out of memory since the capacity is limited. Client-side operating systems are very aggressive with freeing up precious resources. On Android or iOS, your app can be just killed by the operating system at any time when your app is in the background. In addition to it, your app should never crash at all costs. An app crash has a massively negative impact on your user growth and retention. While implementing your features on the client, lean on the safe side, write a lot of safeguards and null checks. Save your data locally or on the server so you can pick up where you left off in case the user quits the app and opens it at a later time.\n\n## Automated Testing and CI/CD\n\nWriting tests on the client is very straightforward at the networking level. You’ll be able to write some good unit tests which are fast to execute. On another hand, UI testing is more complicated, less flexible, and that’s where you get the most coverage and benefit. That’s why we recommend writing most of the unit tests at the networking level and writing a few UI tests for the major flows in the app. While writing UI tests, it’s important to keep in mind that some elements can appear on the screen with some delays. In addition to it, it’s best to mock the network calls to avoid some unexpected test failures due to network latency.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that there are many variations of client devices, browsers, and operating systems. We recommend running your automated and manual tests on the farm of devices. [AWS Device Farm](https://aws.amazon.com/device-farm/ \"AWS Device Farm overview\"), [Firebase Test Lab](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab \"Firebase Test Lab page\"), [Cross Browser Testing](https://crossbrowsertesting.com/ \"Cross Browser Testing Page\"), or [Browser Stack](https://www.browserstack.com/ \"Browser Stack page\") are all great solutions you can use to solve this problem.\n\nYour CI/CD pipeline should be capable of testing and building your apps for testing and distribution. We recommend [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/ \"TestFlight overview\") for iOS, [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-distribution \"Firebase page\") for Android. For your web and desktop applications, you can use your internal test environment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs you can see, client-side development is a different beast from your backend or infrastructure development. With the main focus on look and feel, your app’s mission is to deliver the best user experience possible for the user while using the limited resources efficiently on the device. Due to the wide number of combinations of client devices and operating systems, it’s best to equip yourself with some cross-platform testing tools. Your CI/CD pipeline should be capable of building and distributing apps for testing and production use for all platforms.\n\nDiving into the client-side development can be overwhelming at first, especially coming from the backend side of things. If you need some help with getting things set up, don’t hesitate to reach out. We’ve done it right many times for some great companies.\n","dir":"/solutions","path":"/solutions/client-side-development-enlighten-your-users-with-the-best-user-experience","extension":".md","slug":"client-side-development-enlighten-your-users-with-the-best-user-experience","createdAt":"2022-04-07T16:02:45.903Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-07T16:02:45.903Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1649347412228},"$loki":33},{"cta_header":"Have any questions about Serverless?","tags":["serverless","aws"],"related_content":[],"title":"Serverless Software Development: Focus on Features, instead of the Infrastructure","short_title":"Serverless Software Development","header_one":"Serverless","header_two":"Development","icon":"lambda","toc":[{"id":"what-is-serverless","depth":2,"text":"What is Serverless"},{"id":"why-serverless-matters","depth":2,"text":"Why Serverless Matters"},{"id":"pay-per-use","depth":3,"text":"Pay per use"},{"id":"all-major-cloud-providers-support-serverless","depth":3,"text":"All major cloud providers support Serverless"},{"id":"infinitely-scalable","depth":3,"text":"Infinitely Scalable"},{"id":"be-at-the-forefront-of-technology","depth":3,"text":"Be At the Forefront of Technology"},{"id":"business-problems-serverless-solves","depth":2,"text":"Business Problems Serverless Solves"},{"id":"power-your-websites-mobile-apps-and-iot-devices","depth":3,"text":"Power your Websites, Mobile Apps, and IoT Devices"},{"id":"deliver-relevant-data-to-stakeholders","depth":3,"text":"Deliver relevant data to stakeholders"},{"id":"reduce-infrastructure-cost","depth":3,"text":"Reduce Infrastructure Cost"},{"id":"increase-development-velocity","depth":3,"text":"Increase Development Velocity"},{"id":"handle-traffic-spikes-seamlessly","depth":3,"text":"Handle Traffic Spikes Seamlessly"},{"id":"solution","depth":2,"text":"Solution"},{"id":"strong-architecture","depth":3,"text":"Strong Architecture"},{"id":"efficient-monitoring-and-alerting","depth":3,"text":"Efficient Monitoring and Alerting"},{"id":"automated-testing","depth":3,"text":"Automated Testing"},{"id":"execution","depth":2,"text":"Execution"},{"id":"gradual-integration","depth":3,"text":"Gradual Integration"},{"id":"system-rewrite","depth":3,"text":"System Rewrite"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"what-is-serverless"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#what-is-serverless","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"What is Serverless"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Serverless, as the name implies, is a technology allowing you to run your backend applications without managing the server infrastructure.

You deploy your code and your cloud provider manages the servers for you under the hood. It allows you to focus on your code minimizing the amount of effort spent on the infrastructure.\n\n## Why Serverless Matters\n\n### Pay per use\n\nNo need to pay for idle servers. With Serverless, you only pay for the time it takes to run your application. If you aren’t using your system, you don’t incur any runtime costs. It’s ideal for your development, staging, and QA environments which aren’t used 24/7.\n\n### All major cloud providers support Serverless\n\n[Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/), [Google GCP](https://cloud.google.com/serverless), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/serverless/), and many more providers support Serverless technology. Most of them continue to integrate Serverless further into more of their products. We’re already seeing [Amazon Aurora Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/) database and [Fargate Container](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) engine following the same Serverless principles of paying for only when the resources are used.

More Serverless resources are spawned up when more requests are coming. If there are no requests at all, no resources are running.\n\n### Be At the Forefront of Technology\n\nRunning on your own hardware is complicated and unnecessary (unless you’re at a scale of Google or Amazon), so as running on dedicated virtualized servers (like [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)). Over the next 5 years, Serverless will become the norm and a default choice for new development. Working with new technology is exciting for you and your team! Don’t miss the opportunity to be ahead of the game instead of playing catch up.\n\n## Business Problems Serverless Solves\n\n### Power your Websites, Mobile Apps, and IoT Devices\n\nServerless functions plugs in directly into your API Gateway or GraphQL endpoints. This means they can power your client applications like mobile apps, websites, IoT devices, and the rest of the backend microservices.\n\n### Deliver relevant data to stakeholders\n\nIn our day and age, having access to the relevant data is everything. It’s very straightforward to connect your serverless function to a queue, a pub-sub system, a database or even your file storage bucket. In the case of AWS, all of the major data services like [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/), [SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) all support the ability to trigger a serverless function to take the data that just arrived, transform it and deliver it to some relevant parties. No need to build some brutal long-running ETL jobs introducing some update delays. Process the data as it comes in, and deliver it to your data warehouse close to real-time.\n\n### Reduce Infrastructure Cost\n\nNo need to pay for your servers sitting around doing no work, right? Same for your database, if it’s not being used in your QA environment overnight, why pay for it? By moving more and more resources to Serverless, you reduce your costs and make your CFO happy 💸\n\n### Increase Development Velocity\n\nBusiness opportunities come and go quickly. Being able to develop your software fast, deploy it, and have it run automatically is key for growing your business. Serverless technology allows you to do exactly that. Just focus on your features and let your cloud provider take care of the infrastructure for you.\n\n### Handle Traffic Spikes Seamlessly\n\nEver got a notification about your servers going down because of a marketing campaign bringing more traffic? With a well-architected Serverless system, with all bottlenecks removed (or moved to Serverless) you’ll be able to support any unexpected spike in traffic. With more traffic coming to the system, more serverless functions are spawned up to support the increasing demand. And when the traffic is tailing off, fewer serverless functions are invoked to keep your system cost-effective.\n\n<h2 id=\"solution\" class=\"heading\">Solution</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"strong-architecture\" class=\"subheading\">Strong Architecture</h3>\n\nPutting together some solid architecture goes a long way. To take advantage of Serverless technology, the key is to start thinking about your feature development in a new way.\n\n<h4 id=\"microservices\" class=\"subsubheading\">Microservices</h3>\n\nMonolithic architectures don’t scale well. To take advantage of an Infinitely Scalable Serverless technology, we need to start thinking about our systems as a set of modules. One module for user management, another module for order processing, and so on, and so forth. All modules (aka microservices) are talking to each other forming a robust scalable system where each module can be scaled individually as opposed to scaling the entire monolith.\n\n![Illustrating the difference between monolith and microservices](https://images.rightbalance.io/uploads/monolith-microservices-2.svg)\n\n<h4 id=\"event-driven-programming\" class=\"subsubheading\">Event-Driven Programming</h3>\n\nSoftware systems are built to automate complex processes. Each process consists of some operations. If all operations are a sequential set of steps built in a monolithic way, it’s hard to scale it, hard to maintain it and develop it because all steps are tightly coupled. To take full advantage of Serverless, we’ll need to break down the complex processes into individual steps triggered by events. An example is triggering a Lambda function when a file gets uploaded to an S3 bucket. Once the file arrives, the Lambda gets triggered to process a file and write it to a data warehouse. Doing so allows us to use AWS Lambda being able to process as many files as we want to lean on the cloud provider to do the scaling work for us.\n\n![Event driven programming illustration](https://images.rightbalance.io/uploads/event-driven-programming-2.svg)\n\n<h4 id=\"automatic-deployments-ci-cd\" class=\"subsubheading\">Automatic Deployments (CI/CD)</h3>\n\nBy automating away the process of deploying our code to the cloud, we enable our developers to focus on what matters most: writing code for new features. To do so, we build an automated deployment pipeline which consists of the following major steps:\n\n![A typical CI/CD pipeline](https://images.rightbalance.io/uploads/cicd-pipeline.svg)\n\nYou can read more about CI/CD pipelines in our [CI/CD solution](/solutions/ci-cd-like-ac-dc-rock-n-roll-with-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery).\n\n<h3 id=\"efficient-monitoring-and-alerting\" class=\"subheading\">Efficient Monitoring and Alerting</h3>\n\nEach cloud provider has a specific set of metrics associated with each Serverless resource. In the case of AWS Lambda, it reports the number of invocations, logs for each lambda, number of failures, and more metrics into [CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/). We can set the alerts on our CloudWatch metrics to report to Slack, Email, and Text when some unusual activity happens. To make our monitoring efficient, our alerts will be precise and specific. So when they arrive, it’s clear what happened and what to do next. Each alert has a severity level. If something is slightly off, it can go to Slack or email. And for some critical component outages, it can go to text or perhaps even a call for an on-call person using a [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/) alert.\n\n<h3 id=\"automated-testing\" class=\"subheading\">Automated Testing</h3>\n\nManual testing is great with one drawback: you need to do it again and again every time you push new code. Which leads to a costly big bang releases that are no fun. You don’t want to waste your precious engineering time on manual testing. Instead, writing a comprehensive set of unit tests, functional tests, and integration tests will go a long way. You can add them to your [CI build pipeline](/solutions/ci-cd-like-ac-dc-rock-n-roll-with-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery) to run every time you deploy your code automatically.\n\n<h2 id=\"execution\" class=\"heading\">Execution</h2>\n\n[Right Balance](http://rightbalance.io/) is your development partner helping you seamlessly integrate Serverless into your technology stack. The Right Balance team helped many successful businesses to use Serverless to achieve their business goals. Most of the companies are running on the latest and greatest technology stack, producing a lot of features with increased velocity. Companies running on the latest technology stack is a fun and exciting place to work in. This helps with attracting some quality candidates in the current competitive job market.\n\nWhen it comes to integrating new technology, it can be integrated in the following ways:\n\n<h3 id=\"gradual-integration\" class=\"subheading\">Gradual Integration</h3>\n\nWhen the current system needs to stay in place and it still functions well, a gradual introduction of new technology makes the most sense. The advantage of such an approach is that it’s flexible. It allows for the existing feature development to continue on the current platform while introducing new technology at the same time without any disruption.\n\nIn this case, we’ll start with integrating Serverless into one part of the overall system. Writing a new microservice from scratch and connecting it with the rest of the system using some API calls allows putting the architectural patterns in place laying out the groundwork for new development. Once the initial architecture is in place, we can expand further with either migrating the current platform over to the new stack step by step or continue on the new stack for the new feature development.\n\n<h3 id=\"system-rewrite\" class=\"subheading\">System Rewrite</h3>\n\nIn the case where the entire system doesn’t perform to its expectations when the current feature development is extremely slow and the existing staff doesn’t want to deal with the system anymore, it’s easier and more effective to rewrite the entire system all at once.\n\nHere, we’ll build an entirely new system on the latest technology stack while having the old system running. Then we’ll start migrating the user data over to the new system. Once the migration is complete, we’ll switch over to the new system and turn off the old one. The users will see a new system as just a regular upgrade next time they log in.\n\nThis is also a great opportunity to delight a user with some new features only available on a new system. In addition to it, it’s a great time to update the look and feel of the product on the front end.","dir":"/solutions","path":"/solutions/serverless-software-development-focus-on-features-instead-of-the-infrastructure","extension":".md","slug":"serverless-software-development-focus-on-features-instead-of-the-infrastructure","createdAt":"2022-04-07T16:02:45.903Z","updatedAt":"2022-04-07T16:02:45.903Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1649347412248},"$loki":34},{"draft":true,"tags":["oportunity"],"related_content":[],"title":"DevOps Engineer","short_title":"DevOps Engineer","header_one":"DevOps Engineer","header_two":"","header_three":"","cta_header":"Interested in being our TechOps engineer?","cta_button":"Apply","cta_href":"","icon":"","icons":["microsoft-azure","microsoft-azure-devops"],"image_url":"","toc":[{"id":"overview","depth":2,"text":"Overview"},{"id":"project-details","depth":2,"text":"Project Details"},{"id":"whats-in-it-for-you","depth":2,"text":"What’s in it for you"},{"id":"required-qualifications","depth":2,"text":"Required Qualifications"},{"id":"nice-to-haves","depth":2,"text":"Nice to haves"},{"id":"frequently-asked-questions","depth":2,"text":"Frequently Asked Questions"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"overview"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#overview","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Overview"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"We're looking for a DevOps Engineer to join our team.
