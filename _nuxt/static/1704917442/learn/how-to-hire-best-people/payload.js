Be prepared to do a thorough vetting of technical skills as the majority of the recruiters aren’t technical. Most of the recruiters in the US work on a commission basis ranging anywhere between 15% to 25% of the annual salary of the hired employee as a one-tme payment. Which is one of the biggest disadvantages of using a recruiter, it’s costly. If the candidate doesn’t work out, most of the recruiters find a replacement at no cost.
