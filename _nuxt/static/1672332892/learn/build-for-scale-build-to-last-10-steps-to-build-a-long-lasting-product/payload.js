Sacrificing some quality for speed may make sense while building a prototype at the idea validation phase. That said, once the idea is validated, the product needs to be properly architected for scale. The reason behind it is that you need to set up your product architecture for future growth. If your product is not built for scale in mind, and you try to scale it, your technology will eventually stop supporting the increased traffic. As a consequence, your code will be convoluted to be able to make future changes rapidly, the team morale will go down which can lead to losing your core team members. Time and time again we’ve seen companies not architecting things properly at the beginning. Then needing to hire more engineers later to support an unscalable system. Long story short, if you build your product right in the beginning, scaling it won’t be a problem.

It’s very easy to fall into a trap of introducing a couple of manual steps in your deployment or some SQL you need to run sometimes to clean up your data. The goal is to reduce the number of manual steps engineers need to do instead of adding more manual steps. Each maintenance step you add may not seem like a lot. It’s a slippery slope that turns software engineers into maintenance engineers.

Another issue with manual work is that it requires a context switch. Because coding requires you to deal with a lot of variables, it takes some time to get into the context (what some people call getting into the zone). Switching to a manual task, like updating some records in the database, requires you to switch your context. Then once the task is done, coming back to coding will take some time again because you need to get into another, more complicated context of coding. If you have several manual tasks spread throughout the day, you’ll find yourself not producing any meaningful code by the end of the day.
