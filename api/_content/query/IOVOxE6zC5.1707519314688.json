However, if you commit to doing things right, then eventually, doing things right becomes second nature. In addition to it, doing things right becomes easier the more you do it. So, if there is a question when you should start doing things right, the answer is now. It’s very easy to fall into a trap of introducing a couple of manual steps in your deployment or some SQL you need to run sometimes to clean up your data. The goal is to reduce the number of manual steps engineers need to do instead of adding more manual steps. Each maintenance step you add may not seem like a lot. It’s a slippery slope that turns software engineers into maintenance engineers.

Because coding requires you to deal with a lot of variables, it takes some time to get into the context (what some people call getting into the zone). Switching to a manual task, like updating some records in the database, requires you to switch your context. Then once the task is done, coming back to coding will take some time again because you need to get into another, more complicated context of coding. If you have several manual tasks spread throughout the day, you’ll find yourself not producing any meaningful code by the end of the day.
