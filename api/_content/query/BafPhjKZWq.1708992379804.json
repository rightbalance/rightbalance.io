Software engineers only write application code, the QA team tests the developed product. Once a new release is developed under phase 1, the software goes to the QA team. The QA team executes manual tests by going through the user interface and making sure the product works right in phase 2. If a bug is found in phase 3, the QA team tells the development team how to reproduce the bug. Sometimes a product manager is involved to prioritize bug fixes to go in certain releases. As you can see, it’s a complex process involving communication between developers and QA engineers on a regular basis. In addition to it, there are only so many manual tests that a human can execute per day."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"manual-qa-doesnt-scale-well"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Manual QA doesn’t scale well"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"As mentioned previously, what happens after you develop more features, a number of manual tests increases and teams usually make one of the following decisions.
