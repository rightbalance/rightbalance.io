Unfortunately, it’s not the case with client-side devices. Your user's phone or a laptop can lose Internet connectivity at any time, run out of a battery, or even run out of memory since the capacity is limited. Client-side operating systems are very aggressive with freeing up precious resources. On Android or iOS, your app can be just killed by the operating system at any time when your app is in the background. In addition to it, your app should never crash at all costs. An app crash has a massively negative impact on your user growth and retention. While implementing your features on the client, lean on the safe side, write a lot of safeguards and null checks. Save your data locally or on the server so you can pick up where you left off in case the user quits the app and opens it at a later time."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"automated-testing-and-cicd"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Automated Testing and CI/CD"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Writing tests on the client is very straightforward at the networking level.

That’s why we recommend writing most of the unit tests at the networking level and writing a few UI tests for the major flows in the app. While writing UI tests, it’s important to keep in mind that some elements can appear on the screen with some delays.
