Sacrificing some quality for speed may make sense while building a prototype at the idea validation phase. That said, once the idea is validated, the product needs to be properly architected for scale. The reason behind it is that you need to set up your product architecture for future growth. If your product is not built for scale in mind, and you try to scale it, your technology will eventually stop supporting the increased traffic. As a consequence, your code will be convoluted to be able to make future changes rapidly, the team morale will go down which can lead to losing your core team members. Time and time again we’ve seen companies not architecting things properly at the beginning. Then needing to hire more engineers later to support an unscalable system. Long story short, if you build your product right in the beginning, scaling it won’t be a problem. Your cloud infrastructure bill will be low and you won’t need that many engineers to support it and grow it."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"A classic example of not building for scale is starting with a "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_system","rel":["nofollow"],":target":"\\_blank","title":"monolithic architecture"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"monolithic architecture"}]},{"type":"text","value":", putting all your code in a single application, then taking it too far to later realize that you need to rebuild the entire product.

However, if you commit to doing things right, then eventually, doing things right becomes second nature. In addition to it, doing things right becomes easier the more you do it. So, if there is a question when you should start doing things right, the answer is now. It’s very easy to fall into a trap of introducing a couple of manual steps in your deployment or some SQL you need to run sometimes to clean up your data. The goal is to reduce the number of manual steps engineers need to do instead of adding more manual steps. Each maintenance step you add may not seem like a lot. It’s a slippery slope that turns software engineers into maintenance engineers. We’ve seen the entire engineering team not producing any more new code and just doing some manual tasks to keep the product running. Unfortunately, it’s quite common, especially in large organizations. All high maintenance systems start with just one manual step you leave behind."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"_4-automate-manual-work"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"4.

Coding is hard and there are only so many hours in a day. So it’s best to apply our coding skills towards automating some manual work we otherwise need to do. Another issue with manual work is that it requires a context switch. Because coding requires you to deal with a lot of variables, it takes some time to get into the context (what some people call getting into the zone). Switching to a manual task, like updating some records in the database, requires you to switch your context. Then once the task is done, coming back to coding will take some time again because you need to get into another, more complicated context of coding. If you have several manual tasks spread throughout the day, you’ll find yourself not producing any meaningful code by the end of the day. That said, doing some manual work once in a while is unavoidable.

If an error happens, it should be sent to email/text/slack/PagerDuty or anywhere it can be seen and acted upon. The goal of it is to not create more distractions or more manual work, but rather to find if we missed something that should be added as a feature or an improvement to the product.
