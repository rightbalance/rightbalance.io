A-players want to constantly evolve, and they naturally want to work with people\nbetter than them. Especially if the team members have some complementary skills. They learn from each other and become\nbetter as a team where 1+1 = 3. On the opposite side, B level people bring C level people and it keeps going downhill.\nThe reason behind it is because people who are not striving for excellence don't have the burning desire to be the best.\nThey are ok where they are now. So bringing people who are better than them may feel as a thread.\nThe point is, hiring the A players pays off big time."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"recruiters"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Recruiters"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"A great recruiter is worth it. That said, due to a low barrier to entry, there is a lot of inexperienced recruiters out\nthere, so make sure you’re working with an A-level recruiter. Recruiters find you a software developer on a full time or\non a contract basis matching the skillset you’re looking for. Be prepared to do a thorough vetting of technical skills\nas the majority of the recruiters aren’t technical. Most of the recruiters in the US work on a commission basis ranging\nanywhere between 15% to 25% of the annual salary of the hired employee as a one-tme payment. Which is one of the biggest\ndisadvantages of using a recruiter, it’s costly. If the candidate doesn’t work out, most of the recruiters find\na replacement at no cost.

If you need to fill a role or two and you have a lot of time,\nthis could be a great option.

Each contractor comes with a manager, managing the performance,\nand helping with roadblocks as they arise. Contractors are performance-oriented and come with “batteries included”.\nEach contractor comes with their equipment, health insurance, and they pay 100% of their taxes.\nWhereas if you hire a full-time employee you’ll need to provide them with some equipment, pay some portion of their\ntaxes and most likely a portion of the health insurance, paid leave, sick days, etc."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The only issue with contractors is it’s a hit and miss.

On a related note, candidates usually interview\nwith multiple companies at the same time. Good people get multiple offers (sometimes from large companies like Amazons\nand Googles of the world) so it’s important to move quickly, get your offer in first, and close."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In case of hiring a contractor, you may still do a technical interview to make sure the person meets your expectations.\nThat said, the interview doesn’t have to be as comprehensive as the FTE interview.

Once the terms are clear, the candidate accepts or rejects your job offer.\nThe job market for technology workers is hot. Make sure you have a strong offer.
