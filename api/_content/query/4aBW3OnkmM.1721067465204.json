You can spend some extra money now with a credit card. If you won’t pay it back shortly, you’ll be charged interest. If you don’t pay it off for a long time, the amount you owe increases drastically. This decreases your credit score which is hard to recover from."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Taking on technical debt in software product development is very similar to it. In order to accomplish a certain feature faster in the short term, a developer can apply a hack. If the hack is not replaced with a well-made out solution, the code around it decays over time. In addition to it, the software is built on top of other software. We all use libraries and operating systems. Technologies change and the system needs maintenance updates as time goes by, even if there are no new features being developed. If maintenance updates are not addressed, it also increases your technical debt."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"Credit Card Debt","src":"https://images.rightbalance.io/uploads/credit_cards.jpeg"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"why-taking-on-more-technical-debt-slows-you-down"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Why Taking on More Technical Debt Slows You Down"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"As you apply more hacks, your future development gets slower, you have more bugs in the product, and you get closer to the point when you need to start over.
