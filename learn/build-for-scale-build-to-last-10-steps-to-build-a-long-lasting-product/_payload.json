Because coding requires you to deal with a lot of variables, it takes some time to get into the context (what some people call getting into the zone). Switching to a manual task, like updating some records in the database, requires you to switch your context. Then once the task is done, coming back to coding will take some time again because you need to get into another, more complicated context of coding.
