In 2021, we scaled to 500+ markets throughout the United States. In March 2022 we closed a $10m seed round which included VC investments from Headline, Origin Ventures, Starting Line VC, Ludlow Ventures, and Clean Ventures, as well as notable angel investments from Max Mullen, co-founder of Instacart, Steven Galanis, Co-founder and CEO of Cameo, Joanna Riley, CEO and co-founder of Censia, and Rob Chesnut, Chief Ethics Officer for airbnb. Significant growth continued in 2022 and 2023.\nAs a Senior Software Engineer, you’ll report to and work closely with our Principal Engineer, who is responsible for creating and driving the technical strategy for the user experience. You will help champion the technology selection and best practices in our app and web development. You will help lead the way in bringing technical excellence and innovation to our codebase. You will spend the vast majority of your time building the product.
