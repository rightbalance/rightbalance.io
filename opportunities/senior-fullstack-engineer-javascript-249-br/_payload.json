Over the past five years, we’ve continued to innovate on what a simple payment conversation really is.\nOur platform manages the mission-critical task of billing and payments on behalf of our partners and customers, removing the burden of investing in additional resources, infrastructure, and a customer management web portal. It also provides the 70% of consumers who live paycheck to paycheck the power to authorize bill payments quickly and on their terms.\nLocated in Southern California, we’re located in the heart of Silicon Beach, the second-largest technology hub in the world. We are a lean startup, resourced and managed by a group of experienced technical and business professionals.\nOur testing strategy relies heavily on API testing. We're currently migrating our API tests from Postman into Cypress. In this role, you'll be working with functional tests, contract tests, integration tests, and performance tests.",{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":1781,"children":1782},{"id":138},[1783],{"type":32,"value":141},{"type":26,"tag":143,"props":1785,"children":1786},{},[1787,1791,1795,1799,1803],{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":1788,"children":1789},{},[1790],{"type":32,"value":150},{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":1792,"children":1793},{},[1794],{"type":32,"value":155},{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":1796,"children":1797},{},[1798],{"type":32,"value":738},{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":1800,"children":1801},{},[1802],{"type":32,"value":743},{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":1804,"children":1805},{},[1806],{"type":32,"value":165},{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":1808,"children":1809},{"id":168},[1810],{"type":32,"value":171},{"type":26,"tag":67,"props":1812,"children":1813},{},[1814,1818,1823,1828,1833],{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":1815,"children":1816},{},[1817],{"type":32,"value":179},{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":1819,"children":1820},{},[1821],{"type":32,"value":1822},"1+ year of full-time hands-on Software Engineer experience.",{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":1824,"children":1825},{},[1826],{"type":32,"value":1827},"1+ years of full-time hands-on QA Automation experience.",{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":1829,"children":1830},{},[1831],{"type":32,"value":1832},"2+ years of full-time hands-on Manual QA experience.",{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":1834,"children":1835},{},[1836],{"type":32,"value":1837},"API testing experience.",{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":1839,"children":1840},{"id":222},[1841],{"type":32,"value":225},{"type":26,"tag":67,"props":1843,"children":1844},{},[1845,1850,1855,1860],{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":1846,"children":1847},{},[1848],{"type":32,"value":1849},"Cypress experience.",{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":1851,"children":1852},{},[1853],{"type":32,"value":1854},"JavaScript experience.",{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":1856,"children":1857},{},[1858],{"type":32,"value":1859},"Typescript experience.",{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":1861,"children":1862},{},[1863],{"type":32,"value":815},{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":1865,"children":1866},{"id":261},[1867],{"type":32,"value":264},{"type":26,"tag":266,"props":1869,"children":1870},{},[1871],{"type":26,"tag":35,"props":1872,"children":1873},{},[1874],{"type":26,"tag":273,"props":1875,"children":1876},{},[1877],{"type":32,"value":277},{"type":26,"tag":35,"props":1879,"children":1880},{},[1881],{"type":32,"value":282},{"type":26,"tag":266,"props":1883,"children":1884},{},[1885],{"type":26,"tag":35,"props":1886,"children":1887},{},[1888],{"type":26,"tag":273,"props":1889,"children":1890},{},[1891],{"type":32,"value":293},{"type":26,"tag":35,"props":1893,"children":1894},{},[1895],{"type":32,"value":298},{"type":26,"tag":266,"props":1897,"children":1898},{},[1899],{"type":26,"tag":35,"props":1900,"children":1901},{},[1902],{"type":26,"tag":273,"props":1903,"children":1904},{},[1905],{"type":32,"value":309},{"type":26,"tag":35,"props":1907,"children":1908},{},[1909],{"type":32,"value":1910},"The Right Balance team is 60+ engineers going to 100+ by the end of the year.
