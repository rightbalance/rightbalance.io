In 2021, we scaled to 500+ markets throughout the United States. In March 2022 we closed a $10m seed round which included VC investments from Headline, Origin Ventures, Starting Line VC, Ludlow Ventures, and Clean Ventures, as well as notable angel investments from Max Mullen, co-founder of Instacart, Steven Galanis, Co-founder and CEO of Cameo, Joanna Riley, CEO and co-founder of Censia, and Rob Chesnut, Chief Ethics Officer for airbnb. Significant growth continued in 2022 and 2023.\nAs a Senior Software Engineer, you’ll report to and work closely with our Principal Engineer, who is responsible for creating and driving the technical strategy for the user experience. You will help champion the technology selection and best practices in our app and web development. You will help lead the way in bringing technical excellence and innovation to our codebase. You will spend the vast majority of your time building the product. You must love to code, and want to spend most of your time doing so.\nOur tech stack is mostly TypeScript, allowing engineers to implement end-to-end functionality.

Speed of delivery is one of our core values. If you are an individual with a bias for action, we would love to hear from you.\nThe majority of what you'll do is put together single-purpose lead-generation web pages and integrate with third-party APIs. Our stack is PHP on the backend, jQuery, React, Vue.js on the frontend. We're using Git for Version control, MySQL for the database, and we have several WordPress websites to maintain. It's a full-stack role, you'll be working with both: frontend and backend. The main focus is on speed and delivering results quickly. Because the projects are mostly single-purpose, we value fast and simple implementation over long-term maintainability and complicated solutions.",{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":8166,"children":8167},{"id":138},[8168],{"type":32,"value":141},{"type":26,"tag":143,"props":8170,"children":8171},{},[8172,8176,8180,8184],{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":8173,"children":8174},{},[8175],{"type":32,"value":150},{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":8177,"children":8178},{},[8179],{"type":32,"value":155},{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":8181,"children":8182},{},[8183],{"type":32,"value":160},{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":8185,"children":8186},{},[8187],{"type":32,"value":165},{"type":26,"tag":27,"props":8189,"children":8190},{"id":168},[8191],{"type":32,"value":171},{"type":26,"tag":67,"props":8193,"children":8194},{},[8195,8199,8204,8209,8214,8219,8224,8229,8234,8239,8244,8249],{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":8196,"children":8197},{},[8198],{"type":32,"value":179},{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":8200,"children":8201},{},[8202],{"type":32,"value":8203},"2+ years of full-time hands-on Software Development experience.",{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":8205,"children":8206},{},[8207],{"type":32,"value":8208},"2+ years of full-time hands-on PHP experience.",{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":8210,"children":8211},{},[8212],{"type":32,"value":8213},"2+ years of full-time hands-on HTML experience.",{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":8215,"children":8216},{},[8217],{"type":32,"value":8218},"2+ years of full-time hands-on CSS experience.",{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":8220,"children":8221},{},[8222],{"type":32,"value":8223},"2+ years of full-time hands-on Javascript experience.",{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":8225,"children":8226},{},[8227],{"type":32,"value":8228},"2+ years of full-time hands-on jQuery experience.",{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":8230,"children":8231},{},[8232],{"type":32,"value":8233},"Proactiveness: ability to figure out the details on your own without much guidance or supervision.",{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":8235,"children":8236},{},[8237],{"type":32,"value":8238},"Speed: ability to develop working lead generation pages and get them released quickly.",{"type":26,"tag":71,"props":8240,"children":8241},{},[8242],{"type":32,"value":8243},"Bias for action: producing meaningful results without overthinking or building perfect solutions.
