Speed of delivery is one of our core values. If you are an individual with a bias for action, we would love to hear from you.\nThe majority of what you'll do is put together single-purpose lead-generation web pages and integrate with third-party APIs. Our stack is PHP on the backend, jQuery, React, Vue.js on the frontend. We're using Git for Version control, MySQL for the database, and we have several WordPress websites to maintain. It's a full-stack role, you'll be working with both: frontend and backend. The main focus is on speed and delivering results quickly. Because the projects are mostly single-purpose, we value fast and simple implementation over long-term maintainability and complicated solutions.",{"type":24,"tag":25,"props":3271,"children":3272},{"id":144},[3273],{"type":30,"value":147},{"type":24,"tag":149,"props":3275,"children":3276},{},[3277,3281,3285,3289],{"type":24,"tag":59,"props":3278,"children":3279},{},[3280],{"type":30,"value":156},{"type":24,"tag":59,"props":3282,"children":3283},{},[3284],{"type":30,"value":161},{"type":24,"tag":59,"props":3286,"children":3287},{},[3288],{"type":30,"value":751},{"type":24,"tag":59,"props":3290,"children":3291},{},[3292],{"type":30,"value":176},{"type":24,"tag":25,"props":3294,"children":3295},{"id":179},[3296],{"type":30,"value":182},{"type":24,"tag":55,"props":3298,"children":3299},{},[3300,3304,3309,3314,3319,3324,3329,3334,3339,3344,3349,3354],{"type":24,"tag":59,"props":3301,"children":3302},{},[3303],{"type":30,"value":190},{"type":24,"tag":59,"props":3305,"children":3306},{},[3307],{"type":30,"value":3308},"2+ years of full-time hands-on Software Development experience.",{"type":24,"tag":59,"props":3310,"children":3311},{},[3312],{"type":30,"value":3313},"2+ years of full-time hands-on PHP experience.",{"type":24,"tag":59,"props":3315,"children":3316},{},[3317],{"type":30,"value":3318},"2+ years of full-time hands-on HTML experience.",{"type":24,"tag":59,"props":3320,"children":3321},{},[3322],{"type":30,"value":3323},"2+ years of full-time hands-on CSS experience.",{"type":24,"tag":59,"props":3325,"children":3326},{},[3327],{"type":30,"value":3328},"2+ years of full-time hands-on Javascript experience.",{"type":24,"tag":59,"props":3330,"children":3331},{},[3332],{"type":30,"value":3333},"2+ years of full-time hands-on jQuery experience.",{"type":24,"tag":59,"props":3335,"children":3336},{},[3337],{"type":30,"value":3338},"Proactiveness: ability to figure out the details on your own without much guidance or supervision.",{"type":24,"tag":59,"props":3340,"children":3341},{},[3342],{"type":30,"value":3343},"Speed: ability to develop working lead generation pages and get them released quickly.",{"type":24,"tag":59,"props":3345,"children":3346},{},[3347],{"type":30,"value":3348},"Bias for action: producing meaningful results without overthinking or building perfect solutions.
